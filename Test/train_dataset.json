There is \nno data on antibody responses following vaccination with epsilon toxin.  \nMethodology: Twenty -six L. glama crias w ere divided into four groups which were vaccinated with a commercial vaccine (Mancha \nGangrena Enterotoxemia, Instituto Rosembusch Sociedad An\u00f3nima, Argentina) on days 0, 21 and 42 or left as unvaccinated contro ls. An \nindirect ELISA was compared with the mo use neutralization test (MNT) for measuring titers to C. perfringens  type D epsilon toxin and used \nto determine titers in sera taken before vaccination and 16, 28, 49, 59, and 93 days later.  \nResults: The ELISA gave comparable results to the MNT and showed animals vaccinated once failed to develop raised titers. A week \nfollowing a second vaccination, mean antibody titers rose significantly (P < 0.05) and 7/12 animals developed high titers whi ch were present \nin only one animal at the end of the study (day 93) .

Studies in the United Kingdom \nshowed 4 -11% of llama deaths were in animals under \nsix months old (crias) with a high proportion \noccurring in the first week of life [1].  Enterotoxemia \ncaused by Clostridium perfringens  is a major cause of \nmortality in neonatal llamas [2 -4] and type D \norganisms have been found in llamas in Argentina [5]. \nThe disease is most common in South American \nCamelids  after periods of rain when the p astures \nrevive and the increased protein leads to intestinal \nflora becoming more Gram + and the PFU of C \nperfringes  increasing per gram of faeces. The bacteria \nproduce a protoxin that is cleaved by trypsin -\nproteolytic enzymes to the active epsilon toxin wh ich \nincreases GTPc and ATPc, thereby increasing the \npermeability of the intestinal cells. The toxin also \nenters the blood and injures the central nervous \nsystem [6]. While commercial vaccines against \nenterotoxemia using epsilon toxoid adsorbed onto an adjuvant (usually aluminum hydroxide) have been \nfound to be highly effective in preventing the disease \nin sheep [7,8] and to a more variable extent in goats \n[9], there is no data on their use in llamas [4,10] .",

In \nthis report we describe the characterization of  the IgG \nresponses of llamas to vaccination with a commercial \nvaccine against enterotoxemia.  \n \nMaterial and methods  \nAnimals and experimental design  \nThe experimental animals were part of an \nextensive breeding herd in 9 de Julio, Buenos Aires, \nArgentina. Tw enty-six apparently healthy crias \n(young animals), three to five months old, were \nselected for the trial; at this age colostral IgG can no \nlonger be detected [11]. The animals were arbitrarily \nassigned to four groups: unvaccinated controls (7); \nvaccinated once on day 0 (7); vaccinated twice on \ndays 0 and 21 (6); and vaccinated three times on days \n0, 21 and 42 (6). Animals were given weekly health \nchecks for the duration of the study.",

The sera were stored at -20\u00b0C until \nused in ELISAs . \n \nVaccine  \nA combined gangrene, black leg, and \nenterotoxaemia vaccine (Mancha Gangrena \nEnterotoxemia, Instituto Rosenbusch Sociedad \nAn\u00f3nima, Argentina) was used in our study. The \nenterotoxaemia component of the vaccine is an ultra -\nfiltered inactivated C. perfringens type D toxin \nadsorbed onto an aluminium salt. The vaccine was \ninjected subcutan eously over the shoulder using an \naseptic technique.  \n \nIndirect ELISA  \nTo determine if indirect ELISAs on llama sera \ngive reproducible estimates of antitoxin levels that \ncorrelate well with the conventional in vivo  toxin \nneutralization test in mice [12], ser a from one llama \nvaccinated on days 0 and 16 and sampled on days 0, \n16 and 47 were tested using the mouse neutralisation \ntest (MNT) and ELISA. Thirty albino mice each \nweighing about 22 g were used in the MNT. Serial \ndilutions of the sera from the llama wer e made in \nPBS-Tween20 (1:2 to 1:256) and incubated with \nepsilon toxin (previously titrated) at 37\n C for 60 \nminutes before being inoculated intra -peritoneally \ninto mice, two mice for each dilution, following the \nmethod in the British Pharmacopeia 2007 \n(BPVet2007). Numbers of dead mice were recorded \nat 48 hours.  \nThe ELISA assay was performed as described \npreviously [12] using epsilon toxin (50 IU/ml) diluted \n1:3200 in carbonate buffer (pH 9,6) (Instituto \nRosenbusch SA de Biologia Experimental \nAgropecuari a, Buenos Aires, Argentina) and \nincubated in polystyrene -96 well ELISA plates \n(Maxisorb, NUNC) (100 \n l/well) for five days at 4 - \n8\u00baC. After three washes with 200 \n l PBS Tween, test \nand control sera diluted 1:100 in PBS were added and \nincubated for 60 minu tes at 37\u00baC. C. perfringens D \nrabbit -antitoxin (Lot N\u00ba IRP249 United States \nDepartment of Agriculture) diluted in PBS to 10 \nIU/ml was used as a positive control and normal \nrabbit serum as a negative control. Following three \nwashes in PBS Tween, Protein A c onjugated to horse \nradish peroxidase (Protein A HRP, Sigma, batch 106 \nH82 80, USA) which is known to detect IgG of \nllamas [11,13], was added and incubated for one hour. Following three washes in PBS Tween, the \nTMB/ H2O2 substrate ( 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019 -tetramethylbenzi dine \ndihydrochloride , Sigma , USA ) was added and the \nreaction stopped after five minutes with H 2SO 4 (0,5 \nN).

No other differences were \nfound among co mpared pairs. When multiple \ncomparisons between the 24 corresponding dose -day \nvalues were made with the Scheffe test (data not \nshown), the highest response was observed at day 49 \nin the group vaccinated twice (p < 0.05), one week \nafter the second vaccinati on.  \n \nDiscussion and conclusions  \nOur results show that the ethically, economically \nand technically more acceptable ELISA is \ncomparable to the MNT in detecting antibodies in \nllama sera to C. perfringens  epsilon toxin . Further, \nwe show that llamas exhibit no  apparent side effects \nfollowing vaccination with a commercial vaccine and \nthat they develop antibodies to the C. perfringens  \nepsilon toxin. Animals vaccinated once did not \ndevelop significant titers but those vaccinated twice, \non days 0 and 21, developed titers regarded as high in \nother species (6/6 by day 49). Further studies are \nindicated to determine if these titers are indicative of \nan effective immunity to challenge and how long this \nimmunity persists. The study could also evaluate other commercial va ccines and the most appropriate \nvaccination intervals.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOf note is our finding that an additional (third) \nvaccination at day 42 resulted in a decrease in \nantibody titers a week later when only 1/6 animals \nremained with a high titer compared to 4/6  animals \nwhich had high titers three weeks previously. There \nis no obvious explanation for this finding, but such \ndecreases in antibody following toxoid vaccination in \nimmune individuals have been reported previously \n[15]. Another possibility is that, since protein A binds \nwith only 75% of IgG of llamas [16], the third  \nvaccination stimulated an increase in an undetected \nisotype of IgG while decreasing levels of detectable \nisotypes. Changes in isotype have been reported post \nimmunization [10] and this possibility appears to \nwarrant further study.   \nThe immune response we  observed was only of \nshort duration indicating the vaccine would need to \nbe given frequently or strategically. Other adjuvants \nshould be evaluated which might give high titers and \nlonger duration responses. For example, a study \ncould be performed using BS A emulsified with \ncomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant in the first dose and with \nincomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant in boosters [10]. \nFinally, challenge studies should be performed to \nestablish whether vaccines protect against challenge \nand to determine a definitive vacc ination scheme for \nllamas.",

In these three species the \nblack/gray group is due to eumelanin, which is fully intense in all three species. Red \nphenotypes are due to pheomelanin and fade considerably with age in fiber from sheep \nand goats, but not in llamas. This phenomenon has implications on the genetic mecha- \nnisms used in generating white fiber. Brown phenotypes in sheep are due to eumelanin, \nin goats these phenotypes are equivocal, and they were not observed in llamas. \nKey words: Eumelanin, Phcomelanin, Sheep, Goat, Llama, Coat Color \nINTRODUCTION \nHumans use the fiber produced by a variety of species \nfor clothing and other textile needs; in fact, this was \none of the early technological hallmarks of civilization \n(Mason, 1984). Early in the development of fiber from \nthese species, whiteness of fiber was selected since such \nfibers are easily dyed with several substances to give \nbright colors (Adalsteinsson, 1983). Natural colors, in \ncontrast, are limited to the black, gray, brown, and \nreddish to yellowish shades of eumelanin and pheomel- \nanin. Recent resurgence of interest in the color varia- \ntion of fiber-producing animals and in the genetic basis \nof those colors has revealed some of the genetic basis \nfor the whiteness that has been the goal of most selec- \ntion in these species. We compare here the presence of \neumelanin and pheomelanin in fibers from various \ncolors of sheep, goats, and llamas. \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \nEumelanin and pheomelanin in samples of fiber of \nvarious colors were analyzed. The fiber samples were \ncollected by D.P.S. over a period of several years. These \nincluded all of the common and many of the rarer color \nphenotypes of sheep, goats, and llamas. Samples from \nall available phenotypes were analyzed. Analysis for \nmelanin content was by the method of Ito and Fujita \n(1985) using chemical degradation and high perfor- \nmance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Approximately \n30 mg hair were homogenized in water at a concentra- \ntion of 10 mg/ml. For eumelanin estimations (which \nwere performed in duplicate), 200 p1 of homogenate (2 \nmg hair) were transferred to a screw-capped test tube, \nmixed with 800 pl of 1 M H2SO4 and oxidized with 3%. \nKMn04. The product, pyrrole-2, 3, 5-tricarboxylic acid \n(PTCA), was analyzed by HPLC with ultraviolet detec- \ntion. For pheomelanin estimation, 200 p1 of the homog- \nenate were transferred to a screwcapped test tube and \nhydrolyzed at 130\u00b0C for 24 h with 500 pl of 57% hy- driodic acid in the presence of H3P02. The product ami- \nnohydroxyphenylalanine (AHP), was analyzed by HPLC \nwith electrochemical detection. Contents of PTCA and \nAHP of 1 ng roughly correspond to a eumelanin content \nof 50 ng and a pheomelanin content of 5 mg, \nrespectively. \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nThe results of this analysis are presented in Tables 1- \n3. The advantage of using the present technique to \ndetermine melanin content of fiber is that it chemically \nquantitates both pheomelanin and eumelanin in the \nsame sample.",

The advantage of using the present technique to \ndetermine melanin content of fiber is that it chemically \nquantitates both pheomelanin and eumelanin in the \nsame sample. Eumelanin and pheomelanin can some- \ntimes be confused phenotypically. For example, the \ncrossbred sheep 32 (Table 1) is classified as red but is \nclearly eumelanic. The other common method of deter- \nmining melanin content rests on the detection of pheo- \nmelanin by an electron spin resonance spectroscopy \ntechnique (Sealy et al., 1982; Vsevolodov et al., 1987). \nWhereas the studies of Sealy et al. (1982) indicate that \nthe character of the ESR spectra can predict mixtures, \nthose of Vsevolodov et al. (1987) indicate solely the \npresence or absence of pheomelanin and could poten- \ntially overlook samples in which mixed melanogenesis \nhad occurred. The ESR technique also is limited to \ndetermining the ratio of pheomelanin to eumelanin \nrather than the absolute quantities. The HPLC tech- \nnique has the advantage of quantitating both melanins. \nThe results of melanin analysis in Tables 1-3 support \nthe contention that the black of sheep, goats, and lla- \nmas is eumelanin, and that the red is pheomelanin.

Comparative coat color genetics indicates that \nthis should be wholely red (pheomelanic) (Searle, 19681, \nbut selection for whiteness has evidently reduced the \npheomelanin present in wool-producing breeds of sheep \nNsevoludov el al., 1987).

Several loci in ro- \ndents do dilute color by a variety of mechanisms, but \nthese may or may not be acting in the sheep.

The chinchilla-type alleles could be \nresponsible, as these remove essentially all visual \nexpression of pheomelanin but leave eumelanin rela- \ntively unaffected (Searle, 1968). If this is the locus re- \nsponsible for reduction of expression, then the hair \nsheep (Barbados Blackbelly) crosses should demon- \nstrate segregation of a single allele. Although extensive \ndata are not available, it is observed (Sponenberg) that \nthe crosses are usually born intense red but fade quickly \nto be white-fleeced. Haired portions of the sheep (face, \nlegs) usually retain the reddish pheomelanic hairs for \nall of their life. No segregation seems to occur (although \nuntested directly) in the lambs resulting from the back- \ncross of Barbados Blackbelly and wool sheep ewes to \nwool sheep rams. The lambs tend to be red or red spot- \nted at birth. The expectation of the C-locus hypothesis \nwould be half of the lambs red and half white, which is \nnot observed. Searle (1968) also finds no evidence of the \nC-locus being active in sheep. \nThe P-locus of rodents acts to reduce eumelanin while \nleaving pheomelanin relatively unaffected (Searle, \n1968). This is the opposite of the situation observed in \nsheep, and so is unlikely to be the mechanism resulting \nin white fleeces. The D-locus alleles reduce pigment of \nhair, but act on both eumelanin and pheomelanin. The \nfact that most eumelanic phenotypes of sheep are fully \nintense makes the D-locus an unlikely candidate for the \nreduction of pheomelanin in white sheep. So whereas \nthe exact mechanism of pigment reduction in white \nwooled sheep is undetermined, there are sound reasons \nfor believing that the alleles responsible are not at the \nC-, P-, or D-locus, although the situation at the C-locus \ndoes need more investigation. \nThe genetics of color in Angora goats (the mohair- \nproducing goat) has not been documented, but several \nagouti locus patterns similar to those in sheep have \nbeen noted. In these patterns the areas expected to be \npheomelanic are white, which is similar to the same \npatterns in sheep where selection against expression of \npheomelanin results in very pale or white pheomelanic \nareas in agouti locus patterns. In goats, then, as in \nsheep, white phenotypes seem to be accomplished by a \nselection for reduction of pheomelanin to yield white \nfiber while selecting for a wholely pheomelanic pheno- \ntype (Awh in sheep) to eliminate eumelanic fibers as \nwell. Since the most usual nonwhite Angora goat is a \nfading red, it is tempting to suppose that the mecha- \nnisms at work for white fiber production in sheep are \nalso at work in goats. Both the close relationship of the \nanimals and the common geographic area of domesti- \ncation and postdomestication development favor this \ninterpretation. \nLlamas, in contrast, are camelids, not bovids, and \nwere domesticated in an entirely different geographic \narea than sheep and goats. Still, white fiber is much \nprcfcrrcd in llamas and alpacas when they are raised \nfor fiber production. However, intensely pheomelanic \nfibers do occur commonly in the llama. These vary from \na dark brown to a paler reddish brown, but in any event they are intensely pigmented. The presence of intense \npheomelanin as a common color in llamas indicates \nthat the genetic mechanisms used in selection for white \nfleeces are probably different than those used in sheep \nand goats or that selection for white has been less in- \ntense. These are probably white-spotting alleles, but \nthis remains to be proven. That such could be used to \ngenerate pure white fiber is demonstrated in selection \nexperiments in which spotted sheep were selected for \nextensive spotting until white-fleeced animals resulted \n(Cook, 1950; Panfilova, 1939).",

All chocolate brown goats had low \nmelanin content of fiber, and it is not possible to say \ndefinitely if the pigment is mainly eumelanin, pheomel- \nanin, or some combination. Such low pigment concen- \ntrations raise the possibility that these colors in goats \nare due to a dilution of color that is independent of and \nmore severe than the brown (B) locus action of other \nmammals. The genetic mechanism for the brown of \ngoats has not yet been proven, and these results do not \nhelp in formulating a hypothesis. Brown sheep, in con- \ntrast, are usually conditioned by a bb genotype at the \nbrown locus (Adalsteinsson, 1983). The results on most \nof the brown sheep indicate concentrations of eume- \nlanin consistent with this hypothesis. The decreased \nconcentration of eumelanin in bb sheep as compared to \nB- sheep is similar to results found in mice (Ito et. al. \n1984; Russell, 1946). \nCONCLUSION \nThese results indicate that black and gray in fiber- \nproducing species are due to eumelanin. Red is gener- \nally due to pheomelanin, but is much reduced in sheep \nand goats to give white fiber (wool or mohair in this \nstudy). Intensely pheomelanic types were not found in \nfiber-producing breeds studied, except in the Karakul \nsheep, which is selected for very intensely pigmented \nbirth coat with little or no selection for color of adult \nwool. Llamas, in contrast, have intensely pheomelanic \nphenotypes, probably as a result of less intense selec- \ntion for white-fleeced animals. Those llamas that are \nwhite-fleeced probably result from genetic mechanisms \nthat are different than those typical of sheep and goats. \nBrown fiber in sheep is commonly eumelanic, in keep- \ning with the bb genotype proposed for this. In brown \nmohair the melanogenesis is weak and of indefinite \ntype, and is therefore probably not of the bb genotype. \nBrown llama fiber was not available for study. \nREFERENCES \nAdalsteinsson, S.

Blood was collected from 3 \ngroups of alpacas.  An adult female group was sampled in the \nperiparturient period and once monthly until their offspring \nwere weaned.  Crias born to the females were sampled after \nbirth, then once monthly until weaning.  A group consisting of \nmales was sampled once monthly throughout the study period.  \nSerum vitamin E and cholesterol concentrations were measured \nand vitamin E to cholesterol ratios was calculated.  Vitamin E \nconcentrations were similar throughout the different physiologic \nstates.  Cria vitamin E concentrations closely correlated to that of \ntheir dam.  Significant cholesterol concentration fluctuations in \ncrias occurred after 4 weeks of life possibly due to milk fat \ncontent.  After weaning, the cholesterol concentrations became \nsimilar to the adult animals within study.  Vitamin E \nconcentrations varied with age in crias as they transitioned from \na milk to forage based diet.  Cholesterol fluctuated with altered \nphysiologic and metabolic demands, most noticeable in the crias. \nFurther studies are needed to determine if vitamin E to \ncholesterol ratios would be more appropriate to fully assess the \nvitamin E status in nursing crias.   \n   \nKeywords-alpaca, cholesterol, vitamin E \nI.  INTRODUCTION  \nVitamin E is a lipid soluble vitamin responsible for a \nvariety of functions throughout the body.  Vitamin E \ndeficiencies can manifest in different medical conditions such \nas nutritional myopathy and neuropathy [1,2 ].  Mammals do \nnot synthesize vitamin E; therefore they must consume it in \ntheir diets.  The most abundant dietary sources for herbivores \nare fresh green forages [3,4].  \nAfter absorption of vitamin E through the gut, it is \ntransported via lipoproteins such as very low-density \nlipoproteins (VLDL) , high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and \ncholesterol.  Due to this lipid soluble nature of vitamin E, \nsome reference laboratories evaluate the ratio of vitamin E to \ncholesterol, for example in cattle [5,6,7].  The effect of \ncholesterol concentration on vitamin E is unknown in \ncamelids and it is unknown if cholesterol concentration varies \nwith alterations in metabolic demands during pregnancy and \nlactation.  Therefore comparison of animals under various \nmetabolic demands is needed.  \nResearch indicates vitamin E does not readily cross \nthe placenta in ruminants and swine thus neonates of these \nspecies are considered deficient at birth [8,9,10].  It is likely that camelid neonates are also deficient at birth but this has not \nbeen verified.  Vitamin E is found in high concentrations in \ncolostrum and milk of ruminants and swine [11,12].  \nHowever, some ruminant neonates require additional \nsupplementation to prevent vitamin E related conditions such \nas myopathies due to insufficient concentrations in colostrum \nand milk [1,13,14].  It is unknown if low vitamin E \nconcentrations in female camelids lead to a similar condition \nin crias, increasing their susceptibility to conditions such as \nnutritional myopathy or diaphragmatic paralysis [2].  \nMonitoring vitamin E through gestation and lactation \nin females and their crias would assist in identifying potential \nrisk periods for vitamin E deficiency in pregnant and juvenile \ncamelids.  The objective of this study was to evaluate serum \nvitamin E and cholesterol concentrations under different \nmetabolic conditions in adult and juvenile alpacas.  \n \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \nAn observational, cohort study was conducted using \nalpacas from a single ranch in north central Colorado.  Three \ngroups of 6 alpacas each, representative of the entire herd, \nwere randomly selected.  Group 1 consisted of 6 adult male \nalpacas housed in 2 adjacent dirt paddocks.  These animals \nwere maintained on a grass hay diet with no additional \nsupplementation.  The males were used as a comparison group \ndue to expected stable metabolic demands.  Group 2 included \n6 pregnant females.  These animals were housed together in a \nsingle dirt paddock.  They were fed grass hay and a pelleted \nration1 manufactured specifically for the herd.",

DISCUSSION  \nThe objective of this study was to evaluate serum vitamin E \nand cholesterol concentrations under different metabolic \nconditions in adult and juvenile alpacas.  The serum vitamin E \nconcentrations in the females did not vary throughout late \ngestation and lactation although there was a great deal of \nvariation between individuals in the group.  There were \ndifferences observed in the vitamin E concentrations for the \nmales but not as much variation between animals.  The \nphysiological significance of the variations in the individual \nvitamin E concentrations within these two groups of adult \nanimals is unknown at this time.  The variation in vitamin E \nconcentrations of the males from 5-10 weeks may be related to \na new hay source for the animals.  As observed in Table 1, the \nnew hay samples (Hay-2) sample had a higher vitamin E \nconcentration compared to Hay-1, which was fed at the time \nof initial sampling.  This occurred at approximately 10 weeks \ninto the sample period.  Another source of variation in vitamin \nE concentrations due to feed may have occurred when the herd \nwas evacuated for approximately 2 weeks due to a wildfire.  \nThis happened at week 2-4 for males and from 2 weeks \nprepartum to 2 weeks postpartum for females due to variation \nin parturition date.  At that time an alternate feed source was \nbeing used, yet a representative sample was not collected and \nassayed.  This time-feed source relationship cannot be \nevaluated in the females since their blood collection times \nwere variable and were based on parturition time rather than a \nset schedule through the research project.  \nCrias were found to have large vitamin E \nconcentration fluctuations over time. This fluctuation may be \ndue to the expected low serum vitamin E concentrations at \nbirth, which then rapidly increase with milk consumption \n[10,11].  A decrease near weaning was likely due to \ntransitioning to a hay-based diet.  This change in neonatal \nvitamin E status has been observed in calves and lambs [1,16]. \nThe variation in vitamin E concentrations in the samples \ncollected within 12 hours of life is expected to be due to \npartial absorption of vitamin E from the colostrum consumed \nbefore initial blood sample collection. \nThe consistently low serum vitamin E concentrations \nfor all groups were surprising.  As the hay vitamin E \nconcentrations were low, it was not unexpected to see low \nserum concentrations in the males as they were fed a grass hay \ndiet with no other form of supplementation.  However, the \nfemale alpacas and crias were fed primarily a grass hay diet ad \nlibitum with pellet supplementation daily that was formulated \nwith additional vitamin E.  Approximately 2 months prior to the start of this research, the adult animals received a \nsubcutaneous injection (5 mL/animal) of a commercially \navailable vitamin A, D, and E supplement (containing 50 mg \nof vitamin E per mL) at shearing.  No animals included in this \nstudy received additional supplementation of vitamin E during \nthe sample period.  \nVitamin E concentrations were measured in triplicate \nusing high-pressure liquid chromatography due to the wide \nvariability previously seen when evaluating serum vitamin E \nconcentrations [15] .  High-pressure liquid chromatography \ndetects vitamin E in the DL-alpha tocopherol form, which can \nbe easily denatured during preparation and analysis leading to \ninconsistency between concentrations of the same serum \nsample [15].  In addition, a small volume of serum was \nsubmitted for each sample in order to perform this test in \ntriplicate, resulting in possible unevenness within the sample \nvitamin E concentrations.  Other possible means of variability \ninclude the multistep process of preparing the sample for \nanalysis as well as individual laboratory technician difference \nin sample preparation.   \nThroughout this study the majority of the animals \nwere found to be vitamin E deficient in accordance with the \nCSU Diagnostic Laboratory reference interval (150-600 \n\u00b5g/dL).",

No clinical signs associated with low serum vitamin \nE, or morbidity or mortality was observed in the alpacas \nduring the study period.  As mentioned above, the low vitamin \nE concentrations were suspected to be due to the hay diet that \nwas fed with no access to fresh forage.   Once forage is cut, \ndried, and packaged as hay, the vitamin E concentration \nrapidly decreases within days below nutritional requirements, \nand animals fed a hay diet therefore require additional \nsupplementation [3,4,17].  It is unclear if subclinical diseases \ndue to the low serum vitamin E concentrations in this herd are \noccurring but not being detected.  Alternatively, the normal \nreference intervals for vitamin E concentrations may need to \nbe reevaluated in this species.   \n Serum cholesterol results were surprising when \ncomparing the cria and the adult alpaca groups.  It is not \nunexpected that cholesterol concentrations were clinically \nstable over time for the adult male alpacas.  We expected to \nsee a larger variation in serum cholesterol in the adult females \nas they transitioned into lactation.  Based on lactating dairy \ncows, we expected to see an increase in metabolic demand \nleading to fat mobilization.  A mild change in cholesterol \noccurred but due to the small sample size we are unable to \ndetermine if this is physiologically significant.  This change in \ncholesterol concentration is observed in cattle and other \ncamelid species [5,18].  Values then return to normal as \nlactation begins to decrease near weaning.  \nAfter week 4 of age, crias were observed to have an \nincrease in mean serum cholesterol concentration that \nremained significantly elevated compared to the female and \nmale serum cholesterol concentrations.  Previous studies in \nllamas and alpacas have revealed an increase in milk fat \ncomposition occurring at 4 weeks of lactation and continuing \nthrough week 27 [18,19].   This was found to vary from that \nobserved in lactating old-world camelids and ruminants where GSTF Journal of Veterinary Science (JVet) Vol.1 No.2, March 2015\n\u00a9The Author(s) 2015.

        "2dcaeae3-1aa7-43a4-adb7-86b2614f7193": "milk fat composition did not vary with stage of lactation [20]. \nA recent study found that alpacas are most similar to llamas in \ntheir milk composition through lactation; this variability in the \ncrias may be explained by milk fat composition [21].  The \nmilk composition would then also explain the subsequent \ndecline of the crias serum cholesterol concentration as \nweaning occurred.     \nIn dairy cattle fluctuations in vitamin E \nconcentrations are measured with cholesterol concentrations, \nsince cholesterol fluctuates during the periparturient period \n[5,22].  The findings in this study conclude that vitamin E to \ncholesterol ratios are not needed to further evaluate vitamin E \nstatus in adult alpacas, as cholesterol was relatively consistent \nover time and through lactation.  Due to the large increase in \nserum cholesterol concentrations observed in the crias the \nresulting serum vitamin E to cholesterol ratio is quite small, \nhowever the clinical significance of this is unknown.  Due to \nthe sample size of this study, we are unable to determine if a \nvitamin E to cholesterol ratio is more appropriate for use when \nevaluating vitamin E concentrations in nursing crias. \nAdditionally there are no guidelines or reference intervals for \nthis ratio in camelids to aid in further analyses.  Follow up \nresearch should include a larger sample size and animals that \nare kept on fresh forage in addition to those on only a hay-\nbased diet.   \nIn conclusion, cholesterol was found to fluctuate \nconsiderably in crias over time.  However, the physiologic \nsignificance of this finding is unknown.

Archaeological and genetic evi -\ndence indicates that the llama ( Lama glama) and the alpaca \n(Vicugna pacos) were domesticated more than 5000\u00a0years ago, from L.\u00a0 guanicoe and V .\u00a0 vicugna respectively, mainly in the \nPeruvian Andes (Kadwell et\u00a0 al., 2001) although independent domestication centers in northern Argentina and Chile could have existed (Wheeler, 2012).\nBoth the llama and the alpaca played a preponderant role \nin the economy and the culture of the Andean communities, which persists in the present. It is believed that llamas were first selected for meat production and their ability to carry heavy loads, while alpacas were selected for their fiber (Kadwell et\u00a0al., 2001; Mar\u00edn et\u00a0al., 2018). Thus, physical char -\nacteristics and their diversity in these species were shaped by domestication.\nNowadays, in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile, the alpaca is still pri -\nmarily raised for fiber production, although its meat is also con -\nsumed. In Argentina, where alpaca population is small, llama farming is mainly intended for fiber production. However, in the northwest of that country, as in Bolivia and Peru, llamas are raised for multipurpose use providing other resources such as meat and leather. Additionally, (small populations of) al -\npacas and llamas can be found throughout the world, where they are bred mostly, but not only, for their fiber. Because of their intelligence and docile nature, domestic South American camelids are also good companion animals and they are used for other purposes too, like golf animal-caddy, tourist attrac -\ntion or zootherapy (Marcoppido and Vila, 2013).\nAmong all domestic South American camelids uses, fiber \nproduction is one of the most important for breeders and for the industry. There are several traits that determine the value of the fiber, being fiber mean diameter the most important, followed by fiber length, fiber uniformity, and color ( Mueller \net\u00a0al., 2015; Frank, 2017). Other characteristics such as fleece \ntype and the amount of fiber produced (fleece weight) also im -\npact on the producer\u00b4s income. The elucidation of the genetic mechanisms underlying these commercially important fiber traits would help breeders to select and improve the productive characteristics, as well as to conserve and add diversity to the species.\nIn general, traits can be classified into two types: qualitative, \nsuch as color and fleece type, and quantitative, like the amount of fiber produced or fineness (diameter). Qualitative traits are under genetic control of one or several genes and are exposed to little or no environmental influence. Conversely, quantitative traits are encoded by many genes, each one contributing a little to the phenotype and their expression is modified by the envir -\nonment (Mackay, 2003).",

The purpose of this review is to update the reader \non the current state of knowledge of fiber genetics in domestic South American camelids and to discuss how genomics and the emergence of modern technologies for sequencing and discovering genetic variants will contribute to the advancement in this field.\nCoat Color Genetics\nLlamas and alpacas have more than 22 natural colors ran -\nging from black and brown through gray and fawn to white, including all intermediate shades. Llamas present greater color variation compared to alpacas; tricolor phenotypes may be ob -\nserved and the presence of white spots is common in llamas. Additionally, this variety of colors and patterns normally oc -\ncurs in the same herd, unlike alpaca\u2019s herds that tend to be more homogeneous. The difference can be attributed to the se -\nlection process during the domestication of each species. The \nllama, as a multipurpose animal, was selected for greater body \nsize and fiber weight rather than other characters, such as color uniformity or fiber fineness (Mueller et\u00a0al., 2015).\nNowadays, the value of a particular color phenotype de -\npends on the production goal. For example, animals with nonuniform coat are of lesser value for fiber production but they are more in demand as pets or for animal exhibitions. White color has traditionally been preferred by the industry be -\ncause it can be dyed without bleaching. Because of the pressure in favor of white alpacas, there has been a significant decrease in colored animals, especially in Peru ( Hick et\u00a0al., 2009 ), with \nsubsequent losses in genetic diversity. Fortunately, in the last years, the demand for natural colors by the textile industry has increased along with the worldwide trend towards consump-tion of eco-friendly products. In this context, the vast diversity of natural colors offered by domestic South American cam-elids results very attractive for the current market ( Koz\u0142owski \nand Mackiewicz-Talarczyk, 2020).\nHowever, color inheritance in domestic South American \ncamelids is complex and frequently leads to unexpected results for breeders. For example, the mating between two white ani-mals, may produce a black offspring and vice versa, two black parents can have a white descendant. As color prediction is quite difficult based only on the parents\u2019 appearance, it is ne -\ncessary to better understand how color is inherited and which \ngenes are involved.\nBased on homology with other species, Frank (2001)  \ndescribed color phenotypes and their segregation in the \nllama. Using a scheme of test crosses and backcrosses, he concluded that white (absence of pigmentation) is domin -\nantly inherited with incomplete penetrance and that black is recessive with respect to the other pigmentary patterns. Similar conclusions were reached by Valbonesi et\u00a0al. (2011)  \nwhen analyzing color segregation in white and pigmented al -\npacas. However, the molecular bases of color inheritance re -\nmained to be proved. It was not until recent years that some of the genes and alleles that govern coat color in alpacas and llamas were identified.Color variation occurs when there are alterations in the \nprocess of pigmentation. Briefly, this process comprehends the development, migration, and survival of the pigment-producer cells (melanocytes) as well as the synthesis of pig -\nments (melanogenesis) and its transport to the skin and fibers (Cieslak et\u00a0al., 2011). During mammalian melanogenesis, only two types of pigments can be produced: eumelanin (black) and pheomelanin (yellow or reddish-brown). Basic coat colors are defined by the relative proportion between these two types of melanin. At molecular level, one enzyme syntheses both pig -\nments, the tyrosinase (TYR), but the eumelanin/pheomelanin ratio is regulated primarily by the interaction of two different proteins with a receptor. This receptor is the melanocortin 1-re-ceptor (MC1R), which is in the cellular membrane of melano -\ncytes and has the ability to signal the cell so that melanogenesis begins. If the protein that bind to MC1R is alpha-melanocyte \nstimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH), eumelanin will be produced.",

If the protein that bind to MC1R is alpha-melanocyte \nstimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH), eumelanin will be produced. However, if the agouti signaling protein (ASIP) is present, it \nwill preferably bind to MC1R, switching melanin production \nto pheomelanin (Figure 1) (Lu et\u00a0al., 1994).\nIt is thought that ASIP presents four alleles for the alpaca \n(Munyard, 2011), in the following order of dominance:\nA\u00a0=\u00a0white to\u00a0fawnA\nb\u00a0=\u00a0brown with dark\u00a0trims\nat\u00a0=\u00a0black and\u00a0tan\na\u00a0=\u00a0blackThe existence of dominant black, as occurs in other spe -\ncies, has been discussed in South American camelids, although there is no genetic evidence to support it. Instead, three ASIP \nmutations have been identified in the alpaca, c.292C>T (allele \na1), c.325_381del57 (allele a2), and c.353G>A (allele a3). Black \nanimals carry two copies of one or another of these muta-tions (here referred as the a allele) ( Feeley et\u00a0 al., 2011). The \nfirst two mutations are also responsible for the same pheno -\ntype in the llama, while the third one is quite infrequent in this species (Daverio et\u00a0al., 2016; Mar\u00edn et\u00a0al., 2018). Considering \nall these studies, only the a allele has been molecularly identi -\nfied so far, supporting a recessive inheritance pattern for black, as originally proposed by Frank (2001) and Valbonesi et\u00a0 al. \n(2011). Black animals can be homozygous or compound het -\nerozygous for two of the mutations, but the effect is the same: due to the mutations, ASIP protein is nonfunctional (unable to bind to MC1R), thus there is no signal for switching from \neumelanin to pheomelanin synthesis, and eumelanin continues \nto be produced.\nThe MC1R gene is highly variable in llamas and alpacas. \nAmong all reported polymorphisms, a combination of them (called \u201chaplotype\u201d), has been associated with the ability to produce or not to produce eumelanin. In the alpaca, animals with at least one allele of MC1R with the combination c.82A/\nc.901C (allele E) are eumelanic, whereas animals homozygous for the combination c.82G/c.901T (e/e) are unable to produce this pigment and express pheomelanin instead ( Feeley and \nMunyard, 2009).\nIn the llama, there are three alleles of MC1R E, E\n+ and \ne.\u00a0 A\u00a0 particular MC1R haplotype (c.259A/c.376A/c.383T), Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/af/article/12/4/78/6663962 by guest on 09 October 2023",

One variant of this allele (E) is sufficient to produce a colored coat, which can be black if ASIP is nonfunctional (aa) or reddish brown if ASIP is functional (AA or Aa). In contrast, if the animal is homozygous for the MC1R haplo-\ntype c.259G/c.376G/c.383C (ee), its coat will be white, regard -\nless of the alleles present in ASIP ( Daverio et\u00a0al., 2016). So, \nfor instance, a black dam and a black sire (aa), both hetero -\nzygous E/e for MC1R, are able to produce white or light fawn offspring (ee aa) when they\u00a0mate.\nMoreover, the whole coding sequence of MC1R was studied \nin guanacos and the ancestral allele (wild allele, E\n+) was iden-\ntified (Daverio et\u00a0al., 2016 ). White llamas frequently have E+/e \nor E+/E+. Although not yet molecularly confirmed, we can \nhypothesize that those animals carry at least one copy of the dominant ASIP allele,\u00a0A.\nTable 1 Summarizes ASIP and MC1R allele combinations \nand the resulting phenotypes for the llama and the\u00a0alpaca.\nIt can be observed from Table 1 that in some cases different \nphenotypes share MC1R and ASIP genotypes. This suggests other unidentified alleles (probably of ASIP) are involved.\nExpression of Color Related\u00a0Genes\nBesides variation within genes coding regions, their expres -\nsion plays a role in modifying hair pigmentation in camelids.\nASIP has a complex structure with noncoding exons which \nare alternatively transcribed into different mRNAs isoforms. Differential expression of those transcripts in distinct parts of the body results in the diverse pigmentation patterns observed in mammals. Although the expression of ASIP in relation to coat color patterns has not been analyzed in domestic South American camelids, it was studied for the solid phenotypes. ASIP expression resulted significantly higher in white llamas and alpacas compared to black ones. A\u00a0chimeric transcript of ASIP containing part of the NCOA6 gene was found in the \nskin of white animals while it was not present in black ani -\nmals, accounting for the ASIP expression differences observed \nbetween these two phenotypes. NCOA6-ASIP transcript was also highly expressed in brown llamas, at similar levels to those observed in white animals (Chandramohan et\u00a0al., 2013; Anello \net\u00a0al., 2022).\nOther genes, such as KIT and MITF, which are involved \nin the development, migration and survival of melanocytes are obvious candidates for white color. KIT and MITF genes \nhave been sequenced in white llamas but no mutations associ -\nated with this phenotype were identified (Anello et\u00a0al., 2019a). Nonetheless, analysis of gene expression profiles in different studies showed that KIT and MITF are downregulated in white llamas, as well as other important genes of melanogenesis such as TYR and SLC7A11 (Anello et\u00a0al. 2019b , 2019c).\nThe expression of pigment-related genes has also been \nassociated with diluted phenotypes in alpacas and llamas (Figure 2A  and B). Eight genes ( RAB38, SLC24A5, TYRP1, \nSILV , MATP , KRT4, OCA2,  and TYR) were observed to be \nexpressed in a common pattern in alpacas: high in black, mod -\nerate in bay, and low in white (Munyard, 2011).

There are discrepancies regarding spots classification, and spotted phenotypes are usually named ar -\nbitrarily, which complicates its study. White-spotting is quite frequent and suspected to present a recessive inheritance. This was confirmed by segregation studies conducted by Frank \net\u00a0al., (2006) in llamas, who observed that full white is dom -\ninant over irregular white-spotting. This implies that white-spotting patterns are unable to be detected in animals whose base coat color is white ( Munyard, 2011), complicating the \nidentification of the spotting locus. Moreover, it is not clear if the different spotted phenotypes are product of separate genes, or different alleles of the same gene. KIT has been proposed a \ncandidate gene for this feature since it is responsible for similar white spotting phenotypes in other species (Munyard, 2011). However, no molecular studies have addressed this issue in South American camelids and the locus responsible for spot -\nting remains unclear.Classic Gray and Blue-eyed White\u00a0Alpacas\nAnother phenotype relevant for alpacas\u00b4 breeders is classic \ngray. These alpacas present gray body with whiter areas, espe -\ncially the head, and differ from gray llamas which present a uni-form body color and a usually darker head ( Figure 2E and F). \nThe causal mutation of the classic gray phenotype in alpacas has recently been identified in exon 3 of the KIT gene ( Jones \net\u00a0al., 2019). Gray alpacas are heterozygous for the c.376G>A mutation (p.Gly126Arg), as are BEW alpacas, supporting the hypothesis held by breeders that the latter phenotype is caused by a combination of the allele causing classic gray and a white spotting allele (not identified yet) (Jackling et\u00a0al., 2014). On the other hand, no homozygous individuals have been found for the classic gray mutation, confirming the existing belief that this condition causes early embryonic lethality (Jones et\u00a0 al., 2019).\nOn another note, congenital deafness is a common defect \nin domestic South American camelids that present the BEW phenotype, which is white hair coat and solid blue eye color, as opposed to white animals which have pigmented eyes (Figure 2H and G). No data is available in South American popula -\ntions, but Jost et\u00a0al., (2020) reported that more than 50% of \nBEW animals are suspected to be deaf, based on breeders\u2019 observations in domestic South American camelids from European countries. This number may be higher, as suggested by a previous study carried out by Gauly et\u00a0al. (2005) who ob-\njectively assessed the auditory function of llamas and alpacas and found that near 80% of BEW animals were deaf. Two KIT-\nmicrosatellite markers, named bew1 and bew2, have been as -\nsociated to the BEW phenotype. These markers are in linkage disequilibrium with the causal mutation, which could be in ei-ther the KIT gene itself or its regulatory region ( Jackling et\u00a0al., \n2014).\nFigure 2.

The traits that determine fiber quality are mean fiber diameter, color, type of fleeces, fiber length, and uni -\nformity of diameter ( Mueller et\u00a0al., 2015; Frank, 2017). Alpaca \nfiber is recognized worldwide for its fineness and softness. Llama fiber does not enjoy as much prestige, although different studies showed that most of llamas have fiber diameters < 24\u00a0\u00b5m, equivalent to those of the alpaca fiber belonging to the \nsuperfine category (Laime Huarcaya et\u00a0al., 2016; Hick et\u00a0al., \n2009). However, there is a low level of awareness among con -\nsumers and clothing industry about llama fiber quality, added to inadequate marketing strategies.\nThe structure of the fleece of domestic camelids is given by \nthe combination of fiber length, thickness, luster (or shininess), and the presence and type of curls ( Frank, 2001). Variations of \nthese components determine different types of fleeces. In this way, a double-coat fleece is characterized by two types of fi -\nbers: cover fibers (thick, long, and straight) and \u201cdown\u201d fibers (short, fine, and curly). On the other hand, single-coat animals have fibers with a certain degree of undulation and luster do not present undulations (Frank, 2001) (Figure 3).\nLuster fleece presents less volume and less prickling effect, \ndouble-coat is the one with the most puncture (if primary fibers are not separated or dehaired) while single-coat has the less. In general, the finer and less prickling the fiber is, the higher its\u00a0value.\nUnlike the alpaca which is single-coated, the llama has been \ntraditionally considered a double-coat species. However, studies in Argentinian llama herds found that there is a predominance of single-coat, with lower frequencies of double-coat and luster fleeces (Frank et\u00a0al., 2006).\nAccording to fleece characteristics, llamas are classified in: \nK\u00b4ara, with very short fleece and no fibers in the head and ex -\ntremities, and T\u00b4hampulli, with dense fleece around the body (Figure 4A and B) (Frank et\u00a0al., 2006). With regard to alpacas, two different types of fleeces are described, Suri (luster) with long fiber and Huacaya with fluffy fleece of shorter fibers (Figure 4C and D) (Renieri et\u00a0al., 2009).\nFiber Structure and Composition\nIn mammals, the fiber is a highly organized structure, \ncomposed mainly of the cuticle, the cortex, and the medulla (Plowman et\u00a0al., 2009) (Figure 5). The cortex represents 90% of the fiber and it consists of keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) embedded in a matrix of keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) (Kuczek and Rogers, 1987 ). KAPs alongside KIFs \nprovide the major structural support for the fiber and define its physical-mechanical properties, such as strength, inertia, and stiffness (Powell and Beltrame, 1994). The large number of KIFs and KAPs that conform the fiber suggests that their relative composition and interactions are key determinants of fiber characteristics (Rogers, 2006).Fiber growth in mammals is a cyclical process with rapid \ngrowth phases followed by rest phases. This cycle is under gen -\netic, nutritional, and hormonal control. Fiber formation con-sists of three defined phases: anagen (follicles grow and produce fiber), catagen (follicles regress and fiber elongation ceases since matrix cells stop proliferating) and telogen (fiber is anchored in a keratin matrix and the hair follicle enters a period of rela -\ntive quiescence in growth) ( Paus and Cotsarelis, 1999 ). Control \nof follicle cycling seems to reside at the follicle level and it is believed that growth factors may be the regulatory agents that control the expression of fiber genes.",

Control \nof follicle cycling seems to reside at the follicle level and it is believed that growth factors may be the regulatory agents that control the expression of fiber genes. The proteins that form the fiber are encoded by keratin genes ( KRT ) and keratin-associated \nproteins (KRTAP) which are expressed in a highly regulated manner during hair follicle growth (Yu et\u00a0al. 2009).\nMolecular Studies of Fibers\u00a0Traits\nA few genetic selection programs have been implemented \nin domestic camelids to improve fleece characteristics, among them the PROMECAD ( Frank, 1999), the PROMEGE \n(Renieri et\u00a0 al., 2007 ), and the genetic and genomic improve -\nment program carried out by PACOMARCA (Inca Tops S.A.). Nevertheless, genetics mechanisms controlling fiber traits in \nllamas and alpacas are not fully understood.\nIt is known through segregation studies that luster pheno -\ntype is dominant over no-luster with a penetrance effect that allows some heterozygotes to show an intermediate fiber type. Instead, double-coat is governed by an additive genetic mech -\nanism (Frank et\u00a0al., 2006). The Suri and Huacaya inheritance in alpacas is described by a single autosomic gene with two alleles, or alternatively by a two linked loci model, being Suri dominant over Huacaya (Presciuttini et\u00a0al., 2010)\nThe presence of major genes affecting quantitative fiber \ntraits such as fiber diameter, standard deviation of fiber diam -\neter, variation coefficiency, and comfort factor in both Huacaya and Suri alpacas has been proposed by Perez-Cabal et\u00a0al., (2010)  \nbased on segregation analysis. Thus, molecular identification \nFigure 3. Type of fleece (reproduced and modified from Frank, 2001).Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/af/article/12/4/78/6663962 by guest on 09 October 2023",

Alternative splicing of the FGF5  \ngene results in two transcripts: a full-length form a short form, lacking exon 2 ( Hattori et\u00a0al., 1996 ). Full-length FGF5 tran -\nscript induces the catagen phase, a function that is antagon -\nized by the short form during the anagen phase ( Suzuki et\u00a0al., \n2000). Loss-of-function mutations in FGF5 gene have been as -\nsociated with long-hair phenotypes in some species, including camelids. In alpaca, fiber growth in different regions of the body is controlled by differences in the expression of FGF5 (Liu et\u00a0al., 2011). Moreover, Fan et\u00a0al., (2020) that FGF5 has \nhigher expression in the skin of the Suri alpaca compared to the Huacaya. The same was observed for FGF5 protein expression.\nOn the other hand, a point mutation (c.499C> T) that gener -\nates a premature stop codon was identified in the long isoform of alpacas (Pallotti et\u00a0al., 2018). However, western blot analysis did not reveal any effect on FGF5 protein, suggesting that a stop read-through event\u00a0occurs.\nThis gene was also studied in T\u2019hampulli llamas for which \nthe two transcript variants were identified.

        "4b316499-b7c7-4593-a967-2d0c9b767845": "84\nAnimal Frontiers\npolymorphisms in the coding region were found: a synonymous \nSNP (c.210A>G), a single base deletion (c.348delA), a 12-bp insertion (c.351_352insCATATAACATAG) and the same non -\nsense mutation found in alpacas (c.499C>T). The haplotype c.348delA/ c.351_352insCATATAACATAG codifies for a trun -\ncated protein. All llamas analyzed were homozygous for one of the deleterious mutations or compound heterozygous for both. Contrarily, in the guanaco, who presents short hair, no muta -\ntions were observed. So, we proposed that FGF5 might not be functional in long hair llamas while guanacos have a functional protein (Daverio et\u00a0al., 2017).\nFiber Diameter and Other Related\u00a0Traits\nThe fiber diameter or the fineness represents the most im -\nportant feature for the textile industry. It is affected by the presence of the medulla (medullation): the diameter increases when the medulla (broken or complete) is present and de -\ncreases in its absence ( Guill\u00e9n and Leyva, 2020 ). At the same \ntime, fiber uniformity is related to the average fiber diameter (Aguilar et\u00a0al., 2019). The heritability and genetic correlation \nof these characteristics were analyzed for both llamas and alpacas and it was found that fiber diameter heritability was moderate to low and there was a negative correlation between variation coefficiency and fiber diameter ( Frank et\u00a0al., 2009 ; \nAguilar et\u00a0al., 2019).\nVariation in KRTAP7-1 and KRTAP8-1 genes has been \nassociated with fiber diameter and fleece weight in sheep and goat (Parsons et\u00a0al., 1994; Liu et\u00a0al., 2011). We studied these \ngenes in llamas and found they were highly polymorphic. Most of the polymorphisms produce nonconservative amino acid changes, thus they might modify the fiber characteristics, but it remains to be investigated ( Daverio et\u00a0al., 2019 ). In al -\npacas, Mendoza et\u00a0al., (2019)  cytogenetically mapped several \ncandidate genes related to fiber growth and bioinformatically inspected all VicPac2.0.2 scaffolds for additional genes. They found a tandemly arranged cluster of five more keratin genes (KRT31, KRT13, KRT9, KRT14, and KRT16) in chromosome \n16 around KRT15 which makes this chromosome a good target \nto identify sequence variants potentially associated with hair texture and growth. In another related study, 35 markers were mapped, four of which corresponded to candidate genes for fiber traits (BMP4, COL1A2, GLI1, SFRP4 ) (Mendoza et\u00a0al., \n2020). Even if these studies represent significant advances, it still remains to be investigated how these genes affect fiber characteristics.\nConclusions\nIn the last decade, significant progress has been made in \nidentifying the genes that control coat color in South American camelids. The detection of causal mutations of relevant pheno -\ntypes for breeders, such as the classic gray in alpacas, has al-lowed the development of a commercial test by Neogen (Jones \net\u00a0al., 2019). This is the first test for color genes in camelids launched on the market, but it is expected that others will ap-pear very\u00a0soon.About the Author(s)\nFlorencia Di Rocco received \nher PhD degree in Biological Sciences from the University of La Plata in 2008.

For example, to obtain a black alpaca a pair of the three different alleles is necessary, thus mating could be designed between black animals with different genotypes (e.g., a\n1a2xa2a3, a1a3xa1a2, etc.) to conserve the existing color al -\nlele pool. Additionally, genetic testing can be useful to prevent some health conditions associated to coat color, like lethal gray. By performing a DNA test on sires and dams, alpaca breeders could identify animals carrying classic gray alleles and avoid risky\u00a0mating.\nSome advances have also been made in understanding the \ninheritance mechanisms of other fiber traits in llamas and al-pacas, ranging from simple single gene models to more complex additive multigene systems, depending on the characteristic. Moreover, significant genetic variability has been found in genes encoding structural protein of the fiber, suggesting that genetic improvement would be possible when the variants asso -\nciated to desirable traits are discovered.\nDespite the progress achieved, there is still a lack of large-\nscale studies linking phenotypic traits to candidate genes in South American camelids. In this sense, the release of the chromosome-level Alpaca Reference Genome (VicPac3.1) in 2019 marked a turn point in camelid research, allowing the mapping of candidate genes for fiber traits, the identification of thousands of SNPs and the development of a high-density SNP array. The application of this array in genome wide as -\nsociation studies (GW AS) in both the alpaca and the llama, will contribute to accelerate the discovery of new genes and pathways related to pigmentation and will allow to advance to -\nwards the identification of genetic variation influencing more complex traits, like the ones that affect fiber quality.\nAcknowledgment\nWe would like to thank Eduardo N Frank, Alan Cruz \nCamacho, and Rub\u00e9n Pinares Huamani by providing us with photos of llama fleece and alpacas color phenotypes.

The cumulus -oocyte complexes ( COCs) collected from 3 to 6 mm \nfollicles were obtained from ovaries of slaughtered female animals. The me-\ndium of maturation was supplemented or not with 20 \u03bc L follicular fluid (FF); \n661 oocytes were matured in vitro  (extrusion of the first polar corpuscle)  for \n22 hours with added follicular fluid (AFF) (72.01%) or without follicular fluid \n(WFF) (67.53%) and 679 oocytes were matured in vitro  for 26 hours (extr u-\nsion of the first polar corpuscle) with AFF (92.1%) and WFF (77.15%). The \nresults of extrusion of t he second polar corpuscle as an event related to the \nfertilization percentages showed that the increase in the fertilization rate is \nmaintained at 26 hours with AFF (79.45%), but the percentage decreases \nWFF (65.08%). After 22 hours, the fertilization rate  was 62.38% AFF and \n53.40% WFF. The developmental competence of bovine oocytes is affected by \nthe duration of maturation in vitro  and the inclusion in the FF culture m e-\ndium. The use of follicular fluid in the in vitro  maturation medium may be a \nbiological strategy to increase the cumulus expansion, the nuclear maturation \nand the in vitro  fertilization.  \n \nKeywords  \nOocyte, In Vitro  Maturation, In Vitro  Fertilization, Follicular Fluid, Bovine  \n \n1.

Therefore, the developmental co m-\npetence varies according to the oocyte quality [3] . The competence of oocyte \nmaturation is influenced by several factors, such as ovarian status, follicle size, \ncollection method, oocyte quality, culture conditions, aspiration pres sure during \ncollection, and time between collection and processing [4] . The quality of the \noocytes is determined by their ability to mature, be fertilized, and give rise to \nnormal offspring [5]  [6]. Other important factors are transport tem perature \nfrom slaughterhouse to laboratory, maturation time [7]  and hormones [8] . These \nfactors can affect the possibility of in vitro  maturation of oocytes [9]. The ability \nof a mature oocyte to overcome the stages of fertilization and embryo develo p-\nment is called oocyte development capacity, and it is an intrinsic measure of its quality [6] [10]. \nIn vitro  matured oocytes have lower developmental competence \nthan in vivo matured oocytes in part due to the inadequate in vitro  environment \nthat supports the full development of maturation [11]  [12]  [13]. There is a comp e-\ntition between oocytes, which is defined as the ability of an oocyte to develop throughout the different embryo stages \nin vitro . This ability has been examined \nin relation to follicular diameter because it is the first criterion used for the s e-\nlection of oocytes for in vitro  fertilization [10] [14] [15]. Most cumulus -oocyte \ncomplexes (COCs) collected from 3 to 6 mm follicles appear to mature in vitro , \nbut many are not capable of producing blastocysts [6]  [16] [17]. In addition, the \nFF is a vascular compartment within the mammalian ovary, separated from the perifollicular stroma by the follicular wall, which constitutes a blood -follicle ba r-\nrier [18]. Since the resumption of meiosis and cytoplasmic maturation of bovine \noocy tes takes place in close association with FF, it would be logical to assume \nthat fluid might be a perfect maturation medium [19]  [20]. This fluid is co m-\nposed of locally produced substances within the follicle, which are related to the metabolism of follicular cells [21]. The FF is the product of the transfer of blood \nplasma components through the blood -follicular barrier and of the metabolism \nof theca and granulosa cells [22] [23]. It corresponds to a complex mixture of \nelectrolytes, proteins, hormones, such as testosterone, estradiol -17\n\u03b2 (E2), and \nprogesterone (P4), growth factors, nutrients and other molecules [24]  [25] [26]. \nIt is a slightly viscous solution with pH 7.4 [24] . The FF maintains a proper e n-\nvironment for the growth and maturation of oocytes, besides meeting the nutr i-\ntional requirements of the growing oocytes [27] . \n2. Materials and Methods  \nOvary collection and follicle classification : \nA total of 400 ovaries were obtained on different days reaching 25 repetitions. \nIn situ, the ovaries of the female reproductive tract were sectioned and placed in \na thermos containing sterile saline and antibiotics (100 IU/cm3 penicillin, 100 \nmg/cm3 streptomycin) at 36\u02daC. Then, they were transported to the laboratory \nwithin 30 min after the animals were slaughtered. Oocyte aspirati on was pe r-\nformed with a 5 or 10 cm3 syringe and an 18 G sterile hypodermic needle. Then",

Discussion  \nMammals contain follicles that are in different stages of development, and only a \nsmall proportion of them will be used during the animal \u2019s reproductive life. The \ncollection of oocytes recovered from slaughterhouse ovaries or live animals make it possible to recover and profit from non- ovulatory follicles, which under \nphysiological conditions could turn into atretic follicles. The most econo mical \nand common way to obtain oocytes is from slaughterhouse ovaries. Accordingly, \nthere is robust knowledge about the factors that affect the collection of ovaries. \n[6] [32] .  \nThe relationship between suitable and unsuitable oocytes per ovary is directly \nassociated with three variables: ovary collection and transport, the meth ods and \ninstruments used to obtain the oocytes, and the correct selection criteria. Thus, \nthe adequate training of the operator and the quality and origin of the original \nmaterial (ovaries) are important in evaluating results [33] . \nIn vitro  maturation systems must ensure that the resulting oocyte normally \ncompletes the first reductional division and is capable of being fertilized, giving rise to a competent zygote that can continue its development after transfer [33] .  \nReference [34] described many aspects of oocyte maturation that should be \nconsidered during their  cultivation: nuclear maturation, the ability to be fertilized,",

Reference [4]  stated that the \ncompetence of oocyte maturation is influenced by several factors such as ovarian \nstatus,  follicle size, collection method, oocyte quality, culture conditions, and \ntime between collection and processing. According to our results and those of other researchers [20]  [25] [26] [35] [36], other aspects to be taken into account \nare transport temperature from slaughterhouse to laboratory and aspiration \npressure during collection, oocyte quality [9]  [37] [38], maturation time [39] , \nculture medium with added follicular fluid that contains electrolytes, proteins , \nhormones such as testosterone, E\n2 and P4, growth factors, and nutrients [11]  [40] \n[41]. \nAs mentioned above, FF is the product of the transfer of blood plasma co m-\nponents through the blood -follicular barrier and of the metabolism of theca and \ngranulosa cells [23]  [24]. It corresponds to a complex mixture of electrolytes, \nproteins, hormones, growth factors, steroids, nutrients and other molecules [20]  \n[24] [25] [35] and it maintains a proper environment for growth and maturation \nof oocytes, while meeting the nutritional requirements of the growing oocytes \n[26]. According other results [40], the addition of follicular fluid to the medium \nyielded 78.7% maturation, as opposed to me dia supplemented with fetal bovine \nserum, which resulted in 69.3% maturation. Reference [42]  in pigs showed that \nthe FF promoted cumulus expansion (84%) and male pro nucleus formation \n(62%) of in vitro  fertilized and matured oocytes.  \nThe authors of other studies in pigs and cattle have reported that the suppl e-\nmentation of the media with FF can promote the maturation and/or fertilization \nof oocytes and their subsequent embryonic development [43] [44]. However, it",

Covelo  et al.  \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/ojas.2022.121009 125 Open Journal of Animal Sciences  \n should be mentioned that most of these studies have been carried out with m e-\ndia in the presence of serum or hormones, so the results obtained would not \nnecessarily reflect the eff ect of FF, which could be masked by the action of these \nother components [45] . \n5. Conclusion  \nDespite the different opinions, our results showed that the effects can be o b-\nserved after 26 hours of in vitro  maturation with the AFF (extrusion of the first \npolar corpuscle), with a maturation percentage of 92.1% and a fertilization pe r-\ncentage (extrusion of the second polar corpuscle) of 79.45%. Concerning the \noocytes incuba ted for 26 hours in a non -supplemented maturation medium, the \nWFF (extrusion of the first polar corpuscle) was 77.15% and the fertilization percentage (extrusion of the second polar corpuscle) was 65.08%. The incorp o-\nration of FF to the maturation medium satisfies the nutritional needs of the growing oocytes. The addition of FF may be a biological strategy for develo p-\nment \nin vitro  embryos.  \nAcknowledgements  \nThe authors wish to thank Professor Wilson Espinosa for correcting the manu-script in English and Lic.

Callan\nBackground: Diaphragmatic paralysis is a relatively uncommon medical condition in animals not reported in alpacas.\nObjectives: Describe the signalment, physical examination, diagnostic testing, clinical, and histopathologic \ufb01ndings related\nto diaphragmatic paralysis in alpacas.\nAnimals: Eleven alpacas with spontaneous diaphragmatic paralysis.\nMethods: A retrospective study examined medical records from a 10-year period and identi\ufb01ed 11 alpacas with con\ufb01rmed\ndiaphragmatic paralysis admitted to Washington State University and Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospi-\ntals between September 2003 and October 2009.\nResults: The 11 alpacas ranged in age from 2 to 12 months. Fluoroscopic imaging con\ufb01rmed the presence of bilateral di-\naphragmatic paralysis in the 7 alpacas that were imaged. Arterial blood gas analyses showed hypercapnea, hypoxemia, and lowoxygen saturation. Seven alpacas died or were euthanized between 2 and 60 days after onset of respiratory signs. Histopatho-\nlogic examination of tissues found phrenic nerve degeneration in the 6 alpacas that were necropsied and additional long nerves\nexamined demonstrated degeneration in 2 of these animals. Two animals had spinal cord lesions and 2 had diaphragm muscleabnormalities. No etiologic agent was identi\ufb01ed in the alpacas.\nConclusions and Clinical Importance: The etiology for diaphragmatic paralysis in these alpacas is unknown. A variety of\nmedical treatments did not appear to alter the outcome.\nKey words: Alpaca; Diaphragmatic paralysis; Degeneration; Fluoroscopy; Phrenic nerve.\nDiaphragmatic paralysis has been described in a few\nanimals, including a pony, a dog, a llama, and 3\ncats.1\u20135The condition can be hemilateral or bilateral,\nwith bilateral showing more severe signs of respiratory\ndistress. Diaphragmatic paralysis in animals and humans\nhas been attributed to central or peripheral nervoussystem trauma or compression, degeneration of thephrenic nerves that innervate the diaphragm muscle, or\nmyopathies.\n2,4\u20136Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis can\nbe asymptomatic; however, animals or humans with bi-lateral diaphragmatic paralysis typically show signs of\nrespiratory distress and demonstrate a paradoxical abdo-\nminal respiratory pattern in which the abdominal musculaturecontracts inward on inspiration.\n1\u20133,6Blood work can be un-\nremarkable if an in\ufb02ammatory condition is not present, but\narterial blood gas samples might demonstrate the presenceof alveolar hypoventilation and ventilation-perfusion mis-\nmatch with a respiratory acidosis, hypercapnea, hypoxemia,\nand metabolic compensation.\n1,3,5,6These \ufb01ndings are not\nspeci\ufb01c to the diaphragmatic paralysis condition. Diagnosisof diaphragmatic paralysis can be challenging to con\ufb01rm.\nDiagnostic imaging used in animals and humans includes\nradiography, ultrasonography, and \ufb02uoroscopy.3,4,6Other\ndiagnostic tools such as respiratory inductive plethysmo-\ngraphy and pneumotachography, and electromyogram\ntesting, have been utilized to con\ufb01rm a diagnosis but arenot commonly available to many veterinary practi-\ntioners.\n1,2,6Prognosis is dependent on the inciting cause of\nthe diaphragmatic paralysis and whether the condition ishemilateral or bilateral.\nThis study reports on the signalment, clinical signs,\nclinicopathologic \ufb01ndings, diagnostic techniques, treat-ment outcome, and necropsy results in 11 juvenilealpacas with diaphragmatic paralysis. A single etiology\nfor these cases was not determined because a variety of\nlesions were observed.\nMaterials and Methods\nCase Selection\nMedical records of alpacas with a clinical diagnosis of respiratory\ndisease between January 2000 and December 2009 were examined atthe Washington State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital and\nColorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital.",

There were 6 females and 5 intact\nmales between 2 and 12 months of age (median 4.3 monthsold). The alpacas were born in Washington (n 53), Idaho\n(n54), Colorado (n 53), or Arizona (n 51). One farm\nhad multiple animals affected (n 54) and 2 farms (Arizona\nand Colorado) had crias with similar signs that died beforethe presenting animal. All alpacas presented for signs of res-\npiratory distress or labored breathing. Four alpacas had\nsigns of ataxia before presentation. The duration of clinicalsigns before presentation ranged from 1 to 32 days.\nThe 7 alpacas from Washington and Idaho received\nparenteral selenium and vitamin E at birth.\naEight\nalpacas received oral or parenteral vitamin A and D\nproducts at birth. Clostridium perfringens type C and D\nandClostridium tetani vaccine was either given at birth if\nthe dam was not vaccinated, or beginning at approxi-mately 3 months of age.\nNone of the alpacas had a history of trauma or other\nmajor illness before clinical signs. The water source forall farms was well water. The farm with 4 affected\nanimals evaluated their water source and it was found to\nhave high calcium; no other abnormalities were noted.Alpacaso6 months old were still nursing but had access\nto grass pasture (Washington and Idaho) and grass or\nalfalfa hay (all locations). The yearling alpaca was pro-vided grass hay and access to grass pasture. Trace\nvitamin and mineral supplements were provided through\ncommercial alpaca pellets or free choice mineral salt mix-tures. All alpacas were seen by referring veterinarianswith no improvement observed after treatment with anti-\nbiotics, steroids, or nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory\ndrugs, vitamin supplements, and supportive care.\nClinical Evaluation\nPhysical examinations reve aled rectal temperature and\nheart rate within normal limits. All alpacas were tachyp-\nneic (48\u201372 breaths per minute; reference range 15\u201335\nbreaths per minute) with pronounced inspiratory effort in-cluding nostril \ufb02aring and paradoxical or reverse abdom-inal effort. Others respiratory signs observed included\ncyanosis (n 52) and attempted open mouth breathing\n(n54). Lungs sounds were reported as \u2018\u2018harsh\u2019\u2019 in 4\nalpacas and rales or inspiratory stridor were ausculted in\n2 other alpacas. All alpacas were ambulatory; however,\n4 showed signs of ataxia. The alpacas weighed between13.6 and 36 kg (mean 24.5 kg) and 4 were extremely thin\nwith body condition scores of 1.5\u20133 out of 9.\nClinical Pathology Results\nBlood was aseptically obtained from the jugular vein\nfor CBC, serum chemistry, and vitamin and mineral pan-\nels (described below). CBC and serum chemistry panelswere performed on all alpacas at admission and at mul-\ntiple times for animals that were hospitalized. Arterialblood gas samples were obtained from the medial saphe-\nnous artery if the alpaca tolerated restraint without\nexcessive respiratory distress.\nOn presentation, CBC abnormalities were mild and\ntransient. Four alpacas demonstrated stress or physio-\nlogic leukograms with leukocytosis (median 28.7 /C210\n3\ncells/ mL; range 21.2\u201334.0 /C2103cells/ mL), mature neu-\ntrophilia (median 22.6 /C2103cells/ mL; range 16.8\u201327.5\n/C2103cells/ mL, and monocytosis (median 1.7 /C2103cells/\nmL; range 1.3\u20132.3 /C2103cells / mL). Only 2 of the 4 alpacas\ndemonstrated lymphopenia (median 0.5 /C2103cells/ mL;\nrange 0.4\u20130.6 /C2103cells/ mL).",

Only 2 of the 4 alpacas\ndemonstrated lymphopenia (median 0.5 /C2103cells/ mL;\nrange 0.4\u20130.6 /C2103cells/ mL). One alpaca was leukopenic\n(5.9/C2103cells/ mL) with neutropenia (4.2 /C2103cells/ mL).\nOne alpaca had a lymphocytosis (7.9 /C2103cells/ mL) and\n1 alpaca had a mild decrease in hematocrit (24%). There\nwere no other signs indicative of in\ufb02ammatory or infec-tious processes as the \ufb01brinogen and globulin levels werewithin normal limits for all 11 alpacas. All other CBC\nvalues were within normal reference values. Subsequent\nblood work showed values returned to within referenceranges.\nSerum chemistry panels revealed transient increases in\naspartate aminotransferase (median 487 U/L; range 305\u2013810 U/L) activity in 5 alpacas and creatine kinase (me-\ndian 762 U/L; range 103\u20131,799 U/L) activity in 8 alpacas.\nThese increases were suspected to be caused by the respi-ratory effort, transport, and recumbency. Five alpacas\nwere hyperglycemic (median 288 mg/dL; range 162\u2013\n420 mg/dL) because of stress or administration of cor-ticosteroids. One alpaca was hypoproteinemic with atotal protein of 4.5 g/dL and hypoalbuminemia of 2.7 g/\ndL. Serum electrolytes were variable, but typically within\nreference ranges, and abnormalities re\ufb02ected hydrationstatus and anorexia.\nArterial blood gas samples were obtained at admittance\nfrom 7 alpacas. Six alpacas were hypercapneic (partialpressure of carbon dioxide [pCO\n2] 50.6\u201379.9 mmHg;\nreference range 35\u201347 mmHg). All 7 were hypoxemic\n(partial pressure of oxygen [pO 2] 21.4\u201354.6 mmHg; refer-\nence range 62\u201396 mmHg) with decreased oxygen\nsaturation (23.3\u201388.8%; reference range 99\u2013100%). Four\nalpacas had respiratory acidosis (pH 7.202\u20137.34; referencerange 7.35\u20137.45) and 2 had a compensatory metabolicalkalosis (bicarbonate 32.7\u201339.7 mEq/L; reference range\n22\u201330 mEq/L). When the animals were administered\nintranasal oxygen supplementation, the oxygen saturationimproved in 3 alpacas; however, the pCO\n2, and pO 2,a n d\nrespiratory patterns did not improve.\nToxicology, Vitamin, and Mineral Results\nSerum (n 56), whole blood (n 53), and liver (n 54)\ntrace and macro mineral levels were measured in various\nanimals with most values within normal limits. Minerals\nmeasured included arsenic, barium, cadmium, cobalt,chromium, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, lead,sulfur, zinc, and selenium. Selenium (serum, blood, or\nliver) was within reference ranges in 8 of 9 alpacas except\nfor an alpaca located in Colorado (0.07 ppm; referencerange 0.12\u20130.20 ppm). Arsenic (liver, n 53) and lead\n(liver, n 53; blood, n 51) concentrations were below381 Diaphragmatic Paralysis in Alpacas",

Levels were low in 3 alpacas\nlocated in Colorado (22\u2013135 mg/dL; reference range\n150\u2013600 mg/dL).\nImmunodiagnostic Testing\nVarious serologic, culture, immunohistochemistry,\nelectron microscopy, and PCR diagnostic tests were per-\nformed on different alpacas, with more extensive testing\nperformed on earlier cases. Serum, bronchoalveolarlavage \ufb02uid, cerebrospinal \ufb02uid, feces, and tissues sam-\nples were tested in select alpacas. Alpacas were negative\nfor bluetongue virus (n 51), border disease virus (n 51),\nbovine viral diarrhea virus (n 51), caprine arthritis en-\ncephalitis virus (n 51), equine herpes virus-1 (n 53),\nfungal infections (n 51), llama adenovirus (n 52),\nNeospora (n51), and Mycoplasma (n51). Three of 5\nalpacas had mild increases in West Nile virus antibody\ntiters; however, only 1 had a history of vaccination. Two\nalpacas were tested for myasthenia gravis by administer-ing edrophonium\nbor measuring acetylcholine receptor\nantibody concentrations and both were negative. One al-\npaca was negative for exposure to organophosphates.One alpaca was tested for coronavirus and was positive\non fecal samples; however, phrenic nerves were negative\non immunohistochemistry using both bovine and felineassays.\nDiagnostic Imaging\nLateral and dorsoventral thoracic radiographs were\nobtained on 9 alpacas within 1 day of arrival at the hos-\npital. Three alpacas had radiographic signs consistent\nwith pulmonary atelectasis, 5 alpacas exhibited \ufb01ndingssuggestive of interstitial pneumonia, and 1 alpaca wasnoted to have cranial displacement of the diaphragm.\nThoracic \ufb02uoroscopy was performed on 8 alpacas and\ndemonstrated \ufb01ndings consistent with bilateral diaphrag-matic paralysis. Two healthy juvenile alpacas were also\nevaluated to determine normal diaphragm motion. A\ndiagnosis of diaphragmatic paralysis was made based onminimal to absent craniocaudal movement ( oone-half\nof a vertebral body) of the diaphragmatic crura during\ninspiration and expiration. The reports also commentedon signi\ufb01cant inspiratory intercostal expansion and cra-nial displacement of the diaphragm regardless of\nrespiratory phase in 2 alpacas.\nThoracic ultrasound was performed on 1 alpaca and\nshowed minimal excursion of the diaphragm and mini-\nmal comet tails over the pleura. This same alpaca had\nneutropenia but no other signs supportive of an infec-tious or in\ufb02ammatory process.\nOther Diagnostic Testing\nFollow-up neurologic examinations were performed\non the 4 alpacas that appeared to be ataxic on presenta-\ntion.

        "ccd28303-4884-4b26-ba88-53e359443fc7": "Discussion\nThe 11 alpacas reported in this study demonstrated\nvarying degrees of dyspnea and respiratory distress. Res-\npiratory disease is relatively uncommon in alpacas, and\nother causes of the respiratory signs such as choanalatresia, airway obstruction, depression of the respiratorycenter, restrictive airway disease, pneumonia, or lung\ncompression were ruled out based on diagnostic testing.\nFluoroscopic examination revealed failure of normaldiaphragmatic contraction in the 8 alpacas examined.\nThe other 3 alpacas were highly suggestive of diaphrag-\nmatic paralysis based on clinical signs, and a de\ufb01nitivediagnosis was con\ufb01rmed by thoracic ultrasound or histo-\npathology showing phrenic nerve degeneration. One\nalpaca was found to have signs of pneumonia on nec-ropsy; however, antemortem blood work did not indicatean infectious or in\ufb02ammatory process. Two others had\npulmonary atelectasis, which was thought to be second-\nary to the diaphragmatic paralysis and decreasedinspiratory ability.\nDiaphragmatic paralysis is more widely described in\nhumans than in animals and bilateral paralysis is rela-tively uncommon.\n6Bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis in\nhumans can develop after various medical conditions\nthat cause lesions in the brain or spinal cord, cervicalnerve roots, peripheral nerves, or the diaphragmatic\nmuscle.\n6Cervical or thoracic trauma from surgery, inju-\nries, or diseases such as neoplasia and aberrant parasitemigration, such as by Parelaphostrongylus tenuis , can\ndamage the cervical spinal cord, nerve roots, or the\nphrenic nerve. In\ufb02ammatory conditions such as pneu-\nmonia can affect the phrenic nerve passing through thethoracic cavity. Central or peripheral neuropathies such\nas viral, metabolic, toxic, or immune-mediated diseases\ncan lead to degeneration of the spinal cord, nerve roots,or phrenic nerve. Finally, myopathies can directly affect\nthe diaphragm muscle or accessory respiratory muscles\nleading to respiratory weakness.\nThe alpacas in this study appeared to have a variety of\nlesions responsible for or contributing to the diaphrag-\nmatic paralysis. Two alpacas had \ufb01ndings associatedwith a diaphragmatic myopathic condition and multipleperipheral nerves showing signs of degeneration. The\nmyopathies were variable with 1 alpaca showing signs of\na neurogenic atrophy and the changes in the muscle ofthe 2nd alpaca were either too early to shows signs of\nneurogenic atrophy or attributable to another unknown\nprocess. Two alpacas had spinal cord lesions as well asphrenic nerve degeneration and 2 alpacas had degenera-\ntive lesions of only the phrenic nerve or multiple nerves.\nReports in humans, dogs, and horses describe similar de-generative lesions as Wallerian degeneration or \u2018\u2018dyingback\u2019\u2019 neuropathies.\n7\u20139In horses, a dying back neuropa-\nthy is most often associated with the recurrent laryngeal\nnerve leading to laryngeal hemiplegia.9Similar recurrent\nlaryngeal nerve lesions were not reported in these alpacas\nand clinical signs did not indicate laryngeal involvement.\nCurrently, there are multiple proposed etiologies regardingthese types of neuropathies in humans and animals and in-\nclude inadequate transport of cellular products to thedistal axons, in\ufb02ammatory, nut ritional, metabolic, toxic,\nand heritable conditions.\n7,9Ancillary testing and history\nessentially ruled out many disease processes as the etiologyin these alpacas. There are no reported genetic or heritable\nconditions responsible for peripheral neuropathies in\ncamelids. Three of the alpacas shared a grandsire butotherwise no hereditary link could be made.\nSeveral of the alpacas were in poor body condition.\nThis could have been attributable to poor animal man-\nagement or secondary because of insuf\ufb01cient intake withthe respiratory dif\ufb01culty and increased metabolic activity\nby the accessory respiratory muscles.

The effect ofvitamin E is unknown but might be because of the anti-\noxidant bene\ufb01ts and the supportive role in neuron\nfunction.\n12\nThe etiology of the peripheral neuropathies was not\ndetermined and a common cause was not identi\ufb01ed in\nthis series of animals. Interestingly, 3 farms had more\nthan 1 animal affected with similar clinical signs and wereeither con\ufb01rmed or highly suspicious of diaphragmatic\nparalysis. Two farms continue to have affected alpacas\n(personal communication).\nThe combination of clinical signs and \ufb02uoroscopic\nimaging allows for a rapid and accurate determination\nof diaphragmatic paralysis in alpacas. Minimal respira-tory stress occurs during the \ufb02uoroscopic procedures\nbecause the alpacas are maintained in sternal recum-\nbency and oxygen can be provided as needed during theprocedure. Thoracic radiographs can be dif\ufb01cult to in-terpret as it is dif\ufb01cult to obtain consistent inhalation or\nexhalation images and inhumane to restrict breathing\nin order to adequately access diaphragm position.Hemiparalysis often causes a characteristic increases in\nthe affected side that is easily observed on thoracic\n\ufb01lms.\n4,13Ultrasound can be used but requires a skilled\noperator who is familiar with thoracic anatomy. Other\ndiagnostic testing that can aid in diagnosing diaphrag-\nmatic paralysis in animals includes arterial blood gasmeasurements, respiratory inductive plethysmographyand pneumotachography, nerve conduction studies, and\nelectromyogram testing.\n1,2,6Transcranial magnetic stim-\nulation is a relatively new tool for use in animals andmight be helpful in evaluating nerve conduction abnor-\nmalities and localizing spinal cord lesions.\n14\nPrognosis for bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis in\nalpacas appears guarded, particularly when both respi-\nratory and neurologic de\ufb01cits are observed.

R AMOS -VARA\nAnimal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and Department of Comparative Pathobiology (PM, JAR) and\nDepartment of Veterinary Clinical Sciences (ML, JES), Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN\nAbstract. Cerebellar abiotrophy, a premature degeneration of cerebellar neurons, has been described\nin most domestic animals. Affected animals typically present with progressive neurologic signs after avariable period of postnatal normalcy. This report describes the clinical, histopathologic, and\nimmunohistochemical (IHC) findings of cerebellar abiotrophy in an alpaca. The alpaca developed\nintention tremors, hypermetria, and a wide-based stance at 1.5 years of age. Histologic lesions, confinedto the cerebellar vermis, included marked absence of Purkinje cells, decreased granule cells, narrowing of\nthe molecular layer, and thinning of white matter tracts consistent with abiotrophy. Increased cell\nprocesses in the molecular layer immunolabeled for glial fibrillary acidic protein, whereasimmunoreactivity for neurofilament was reduced in the molecular layer and cerebellar folia white\nmatter. To the investigators\u2019 knowledge, this is the first report of cerebellar abiotrophy in a camelid and\nthe first documentation of IHC findings associated with this condition.\nKey words: Abiotrophy; alpaca; cerebellum; GFAP; immunohistochemistry; neurofilament.\nCerebellar abiotrophy denotes premature degenera-\ntion of fully formed cerebellar neurons due to an\nintrinsic metabolic defect, often suspected to be inher-\nited as an autosomal recessive condition.\n1,11This differs\nfrom hypoplasia, in which the cerebellum fails to form\ncompletely during development. Clinically, animals with\ncerebellar abiotrophy are born with normal neurologic\nfunction followed by delayed onset of clinical signs\nranging from a few weeks to several years of age,\ncorresponding to the onset of neuronal degeneration.\nThe disease is progressive, although in some cases\naffected animals reach a stage at which clinical signs\nplateau.5,11Typically, Purkinje cells undergo primary\ndegeneration; granule cell loss is considered secondary,as are reactive gliosis and Wallerian-type degenera-\ntion.\n1,11Cerebellar abiotrophy has been reported in\nmost domestic species,11although not in camelids, to\nour knowledge. The present report describes the clinical,microscopic, and immunohistochemical (IHC) features\nof a putative case of cerebellar abiotrophy in an alpaca.\nA 1.5-year-old female alpaca presented to Purdue\nUniversity Veterinary Teaching Hospital with a primary\ncomplaint of trembling of the head and neck and\nabnormal gait of 3 months\u2019 duration. The animal had\nbeen treated for suspected meningeal worm infestation\nwithout noticeable improvement. The neurologic exam-\nination showed normal behavior and no cranial nervedeficits. Subtle head tremors were present at rest and\nworsened when the animal reached for food. The alpaca\nwould stand with a wide-based stance and, when\nwalking, showed moderately severe ataxia and hyper-\nmetria. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) aspiration and acomputed tomography (CT) scan were performed; the\nprotein content of the CSF was 20 mg/dl (reference\nrange,66.8 mg/dl) and there was 1 white blood cell/\nml\nand 0 red blood cells.13Serologic testing for antibodies\nagainst West Nile and Equine Herpes virus was negative\nby virus neutralization, and no viruses were isolated from\nthe CSF. On CT, there was increased area of fluid opacity\nalong the dorsal margin of the rostral cerebellum. This\nsuggested a small cerebellum such as from hypoplasia,\natrophy, or degeneration, or less likely a cystic area near\nthe tentorium cerebelli.

Asecond differential diagnosis was cerebellar degeneration,a term that describes a similar clinical syndrome and\nhistologic lesion but implies an extrinsic etiology.\n3In the\npresent case, no other alpacas on the farm were affected tosuggest a toxic or nutritional cause. In addition, noevidence of infectious disease was detected microscopi-\ncally or with ancillary diagnostic tests. It is unknown\nwhether normal offspring had previously been producedby the same breeding pair that sired this alpaca to evaluatepotential inheritance. Histologic findings in this case weresimilar to those described in several breeds of sheep\n3,5,10\nand calves.4,6,11Interestingly, the vermis was particularly\naffected in the present alpaca, similar to reports inWiltshire sheep\n3and Holstein Friesian calves.4Summers\net al.11suggested that abiotrophy may arise in the vermis\nand progress to other regions of the cerebellum. Also,\nthese investigators noted the impressive transition fromnormal and abnormal cortex within a single folia, as seen\nin the present case.\nApplication of IHC markers in this alpaca provided\nadditional information regarding lesion development. In\nparticular, antibodies against GFAP depicted markedastrogliosis with processes extending into the molecular\nlayer. However, astrocytosis within the Purkinje cell\nlayer (Bergmann astrocytes) or in the granular layer was\nnot as remarkable. Although many reports described\ngliosis as a secondary change in cerebellar abio-trophy,\n3\u20136,11visualization of these cells and their\nprocesses by GFAP immunolabeling emphasized that\nthe marked cellular response was one of hypertrophy\nand proliferation of cell processes rather than hyperpla-sia. The mechanism of astroglial reaction demonstrated\nin the present case may reflect a specific spectrum of\ncytokines associated with cellular degeneration com-\npared with the array of cytokines that might beassociated with outright neuronal necrosis. Although acomparison to cerebellar hypoplasia was not made in this\nalpaca, GFAP immunoreactivity may provide differenti-\nation between hypoplasia and early-onset abiotrophy, asgliosis in the former occurs mostly in the white matter.\n9\nBecause animals with cerebellar hypoplasia demonstrateneurologic signs at birth compared with the postnatal\ndisease development in abiotrophy, the distinction\nbetween these two conditions would only be important\nwhen the onset of clinical signs in a young animal is\nunknown.

Gerken-\nDepartment of Animal Sciences, Go \u00a8ttingen University, Albrecht-Thaer-Weg 3, 37075 Go \u00a8ttingen, Germany\n(Received 27 April 2009; Accepted 9 October 2009; First published online 20 November 2009)\nHair \ufb01bre is regarded as a unique mammalian feature with an important role for endothermy. Arti\ufb01cial selection for hair\ncharacteristics resulted in marked changes with regard to follicle number, type, distribution, growth and natural shedding.\nThis review focuses on the \ufb01ne \ufb01bre-producing South American camelids (SACs) and the relationship between their hair coat\nand thermoregulation. SACs have developed several special integumental characteristics. While the hair coat of the wild\nlamoids vicun \u02dca (Vicugna vicugna ) and guanaco ( Lama guanicoe ) is formed by two types of hair (the coarse outer guard hairs\nand a \ufb01ner undercoat), the domesticated llamas ( Lama glama ) and alpaca ( Lama pacos ) exhibit variably double coat and\npredominantly single coat, respectively. The distribution of the hair coat across the body is not homogenous. Thermal windows\nwith shorter hair or thinner skin can be identi\ufb01ed at the ventral abdomen, axillary space and inside of the thighs (about 20%\nof the skin), thus allowing to modulate heat dissipation. In contrast to sheep wool, lamoid \ufb01bres are mainly medullated.\nThe thermal conductance of summer pelage was higher than that of the winter \ufb02eece and highest for the axillar and lower\n\ufb02anks. Lamoids have developed behavioural strategies to modify heat loss by adopting speci\ufb01c postures according to ambient\nconditions by closing or opening the thermal windows. Energy savings of 67% attributed to posture were calculated. SACs have\nshown to be able to adapt to a broad range of different climatic conditions. The speci\ufb01c integumental characteristics of SACs\nindicate that they have developed adaptation mechanisms particularly suited for cooler climates. Accordingly, hyperthermia\nmight become a problem in hot, humid areas outside of their original habitat. Several studies showed the bene\ufb01cial effect\nof shearing against heat stress. In particular, fertility in males exposed to heat stress may be improved by shearing. Infrared\nthermography reveals that in shorn animals the heat is radiated across the entire body surface and is not restricted to the\nthermal windows. However, shearing also changes the conditions of the protective layer, resulting in a loss of thermal\nconductance that may result in adverse effects when animals are kept under cold temperatures. The length of residual \ufb01bre\nappears to be crucial in avoiding excessive heat loss in a cold environment, as demonstrated by shearing experiments with\ndifferent shearing machines. There is, therefore, potential for welfare considerations to con\ufb02ict with industrial demands for\n\ufb01bre length or homogenous quality.\nKeywords: \ufb01bre, thermoregulation, shearing, South American camelids\nImplications\nFibre is of vital importance for endothermy in mammals.

Hair \ufb01bre in mammals has some apparent advantages\nfor thermoregulation over scales as found in ectotherm reptilesas it allows a more \ufb02exible adaptation of the body surfaceto environmental conditions. In particu lar, air with its minimal\nthermal conductivity is trapped within (medullation) and\nbetween hairs resulting in improved insulation.\nIn the process of domestication by humans, some species\nhave been selected for their hair characteristics. Usually,commercialised animal \ufb01bres are divided according to theirorigin into wool (sheep) and \ufb01ne \ufb01bre (e.g. goats, camels,South American camelids (SACs) and yak). The arti\ufb01cialselection resulted in marked changes with regard to folliclenumber, type, distribution, growth and even natural shed-ding (Allain and Renieri, 2010; Antonini, 2010; Galbraith,\n2010a). The impact of these genetic manipulations on\nthe adaptation and acclimatisation of the animals is notcompletely understood. This review focuses on the \ufb01ne\ufb01bre-producing SACs and the role of hair for their thermo-regulation. Emphasis will be on the relationship betweenintegumental characteristics and thermoregulation.\nTemperature regulation\nThe energy budget for an animal with fur depends on many\nfactors, and several general models have been proposedincluding the special role of the hair coat (e.g. Walsberg\net al ., 1978; Turnpenny et al ., 2000).\nThermoregulation is part of a homoeostatic mechanism\nrelated to energy metabolism as it keeps the organism at\noptimum operating temperature within certain boundaries,\neven when the surrounding temperature is very different. Inmammals, endothermic homoeothermy generally resultsfrom a combination of high resting, aerobically supportedheat production rates (about \ufb01ve- to tenfold that of reptiles)in all soft tissues and suf\ufb01cient insulation to retard exces-sive heat loss (Ruben, 1995; Grigg\net al ., 2004).\nA schematic overview on thermoregulatory mechanisms\nincluding the role of \ufb01bre is given in Figure 1. These\nmechanisms can be divided into those concerned with themodulation of the rate of heat production and those mod-ulating the rate of heat \ufb02ow into or out of the organism (Bligh,1998). The processes of energ y transfer include the sensible\nheat transfer (\ufb02ow of energy into or out of the organismby convection, conduction or rad iation) and the insensible\nheat transfer through evaporation (energy transfer from the\norganism to the environment). During evaporation, a thermal\ngradient through the peripheral body tissues from the core tothe skin is created or enhanced. Evaporative cooling involvesthe transfer of water to water vapour, which requires 2443 J/gof water converted.

The wild lamoids\nvicun\u02dca (Vicugna vicugna ) and guanaco ( Lama guanicoe )\nsurvive in a broad range of different harsh climatic condi-tions ranging from the Puna highlands of the Andes andaltitudes above 3500 m to the sea coast. The domesticlamoids, llama (\nLama glama) and alpaca ( Lama pacos ) have\nshown themselves to be able to adapt to very differentclimatic conditions all over the world.\nDuring evolution, SACs have developed several integu-\nmental characteristics to allow adaptation to environmentalchanges (Atlee\net al ., 1997; Fowler, 1998). It is notable that\nin wild lamoid guanaco and vicun \u02dc a genotypes, the hair coat\nis formed by two types of hair \u2013 the coarse outer guardhairs and a \ufb01ner undercoat, which is typical of the \u2018doublecoat\u2019 found in other undomesticated mammalian species.In contrast, variations in coat morphology are observed inthe domesticated llamas (\nL. glama) and alpaca ( L. pacos )\nthat exhibit variably double coat and predominantly single\ncoat, respectively. Further details of hair follicle morphologyin SACs are given elsewhere (Antonini, 2010). The doublecoat may be hypothesised to represent a speci\ufb01c adaptationto the harsh environment in which longer thicker guard\nhair on the \ufb02eece surface may promote shedding of waterand also act as a physical barrier against wind. The major\noutcome is, thus, the protection of the underlying \ufb01ner\nundercoat and skin and the reduction of body heat loss.\nIn SACs, the distribution of the hair coat across the\nbody is not homogenous, and several \u2018thermal windows\u2019\n(Figure 2) can be identi\ufb01ed at the ventral abdomen, axillaryspace and inside the thighs with fewer hair follicles, shorter\nhair or thinner skin (Fowler, 1994). Morrison (1966) esti-mated for a male guanaco the surface areas with fur ofdifferent thickness (Table 1). About 40% of the guanaco\nskin was covered by heavy fur, but almost 20% was nearly\nbare allowing to modulate heat dissipation (Morrison,1966). Parallel differences in dermis thickness weredescribed by Atlee\net al . (1997) for the llama. The average\ndermal thickness was 3.1 mm. The thickest dermis wasfound for the neck with 4.6 and 5.1 mm for the dorsal andlateral aspects of the neck, respectively. Ventral areas werecovered by a much thinner dermis of 2 to 3 mm.\nThe density of the hair varies with body region, with the\nthickest \ufb01bre on the back and the sides, and follicles thatproduce the hair are oriented in a sharp oblique angle(Atlee\net al., 1997). It is suspected that this pattern providesinsulation and protection to extreme climatic conditions.This marked angulation of the hair follicle is in contrast tosheep in which the follicles are generally orientated almostperpendicular to the skin surface (Atlee\net al ., 1997).\nEach hair follicle is associated with sebaceous glands, but\nin lamoids, the production of grease is low in comparison tothat of sheep with percentages in raw material rangingbetween 0.8% and 5% in lamoids\nv.10% and 25% in\nsheep (Dawes, 1973; Duga, 1986).",

In llamas, well-developed\nArrector pili muscles are associated wit h larger hair follicles in\nthe areas of long dense haircoat (Atlee et al., 1997), whereas\nthey are small and rudimentary in areas with short sparsehaircoat (\u2018thermal windows\u2019).\nIn contrast to sheep wool, lamoid \ufb01bres are mainly\nmedullated (Antonini, 2010).

The highest mean conductance(2.68 W/m\n28C) was found for the axillar and lower \ufb02anks,\nwhich coincide with the \u2018thermal windows\u2019 (Morrison, 1966;Fowler, 1994).

Nor-\nmal body temperatures of neonates may be a degree higher\nthan that of the adults (Fowler, 1994). In guanacos, body\ntemperatures were measured by telemetry in winter andsummer under natural conditions in Argentine. Body tem-peratures \ufb02uctuated between 37.2 8C and 39.7 8C in both\nseasons. The diurnal temperature pattern was characterised\nby a sinusoidal variation with high body temperatures\nduring the daytime and low ones after the sunset with daily\ufb02uctuations larger than 1.0 8C (de Lamo, 1990). In llamas\nand alpacas, diurnal patterns of core body temperaturewere found to lag behind the diurnal ambient temperatureby 6 to 8 h (Bligh\net al ., 1975).\nData on thermoneutral zones for camelids appear to lack.\nSome indirect conclusions may be drawn by studies con-\nducted on sweating. In guanacos, ambient temperaturesbetween 20 8C and 33 8C were the main stimuli for activa-\ntion of sweat glands. The total heat loss by evaporation\ncalculated at ambient temperatures of 20 8C and 30 8C were\n11.9% and 37%, respectively, of the standing basal meta-\nbolic rate (de Lamo, 1990; de Lamo\net al ., 2001).

However, they may come under severe heat stresswhen living in countries with extremely hot summers; ani-mals which die from heat have been reported, for example,from Texas (Rotter, 1991; Fowler, 1994). In a hot climate,adult lamoids may maintain a daytime core body tem-perature of 40 8C (Fowler, 1994). Body temperatures in lla-\nmas and alpacas rarely exceed 43.3 8C, and animals in\nsevere heat stress may have temperatures of only 41.1 8Ct o\n42.28C. Protein denaturation takes place at temperatures of\n458Ct o4 7 8C, causing irreversible defects of tissues and\norgans (Fowler, 1994).\nAlpacas are reported to be more tolerant to heat than\nllamas. This may be due to the larger body size in llamascompared with alpacas (Navarre\net al ., 2001), and thus\ntheir less favourable relation between body mass and bodysurface for heat dissipation.\nIn a study by Gerken\net al . (2003), rectal temperatures\nand ambient temperatures were taken in 14 adult female,unshorn llamas (ambient temperatures between 20.48C and\n25.18C). The \ufb01bre lengths varied between 70 and 240 mm,\nwith an average of 125.7 mm. Spearman correlation coef\ufb01-cients between \ufb01bre length and rectal temperatures were\nnot signi\ufb01cant. The highest values were obtained for the\ncorrelation with \ufb01bre length of the shoulder (\nr50.49) and\nbelly ( r50.28); the lowest for neck ( r50.13), back\n(r52 0.14) and thigh ( r52 0.04). The higher correlations\nwith shoulder and belly hair length might underline theimportance of these regions for thermoregulation as thermalwindows (Morrison, 1966; Fowler, 1994).\nBehavioural adaptation\nBehavioural modi\ufb01cation of the hair coat aiding thermo-\nregulation includes piloerection by small muscles at thebase of primary follicles. It is open to question, however, towhich extent camelids are using piloerection to minimise\ncold or heat stress.\nLamoids have developed behavioural strategies to modify\nconvective heat loss by adopting speci\ufb01c postures accord-\ning to ambient conditions. The behavioural patterns include\nthe closing or opening of the \u2018thermal windows\u2019, thusdecreasing heat loss through radiation and convection(Atlee\net al .,1997). In Guanacos de Lamo et al .

When Ta was below 0 8Ct o18C, the guanacos tended\nto bed. In llamas, Milz (2001) observed more lying with\nelongated neck under high temperatures.Gerken\n1454",

Lamoids are described to readily use water for\ncooling (Rotter, 1991). Lamoids use dry sand, dust or bareplaces for rolling behaviour. Subse quent to rolling, they\nexhibit body shaking (Pilters, 1954). The rolling behaviourmay also serve to improve the thermoregulatory properties ofthe pelage by removing adherent sweat, grease or dirt andaligning the \ufb01bre, comparable to dustbathing in birds (Gerken\net al ., 2006).\nFleece surface temperature\nThe knowledge of the surface area of an animal is impor-\ntant to determine the heat loss for a particular environment.In adult guanacos (80 to 100 kg), the surface area varied\nfrom 1.68 to 1.92 m\n2(de Lamo, 1990).\nThe surface temperature of an animal can be measured by\nthe radiated electromagnetic waves. Infrared thermography\noffers an excellent non-invasive tool for measuring this infra-\nred radiation on the boundary layer of an animal (de Lamo,1990; Gerken, 1996; Gerken\net al ., 2006; McCafferty, 2007;\nSchwalm et al., 2008). Figure 3 shows the thermal windows at\nthe ventral abdomen, axillary space and inside of the thighs\nemitting higher infrared radiation.\nSurface temperature depicts the thermal energy that\n\ufb02ows between the outer surface of the body and theenvironment. In a study in guanacos kept between 2118C\nand 27.5 8C, the mean surface temperature (thermal ima-\nging camera, measuring infrared radiation between 2 and14mm) decreased with decreasing ambient temperature\nuntil this reached 0 8C. Below that point, mean surface\ntemperature remained nearly constant at 6 8Ct o88C. In the\nmodel proposed by de Lamo (1990), radiative heat loss wascalculated to \ufb02uctuate between 58.8 W/m\n2at2118C and\n23.3 W/m2at 27.5 8C in a 90 kg guanaco.\nMcArthur (1991) considered the heat exchange on the coat\nsurface in sheep kept outdoors during night. The calculated\ufb02ux density of latent heat gained at the coat surface on theback of a sheep could exceed 30 W/m\n2. When the surface\ntemperature cools to the dew point temperature of the air,\ncondensation onto the hair coat will occur and the \ufb02eece may\naccumulate up to 0.1 kg of water during the night.\nTemperature within the \ufb02eece\nAnalysis of heat \ufb02ow through animal coats is complicated\ndue to the involvement of several modes of heat transfer. In\naddition, wind may open the \ufb02eece and reduce the insu-\nlation of the hair coat (Turnpenny et al ., 2000).\nA \ufb02eece contains air spaces with water vapour that is in\nequilibrium with the water either absorbed or adsorbed on\nthe wool \ufb01bres (Gatenby et al ., 1983), with the latent heat\nof vaporisation of water having an important effect on the\nenergy budget of the animal (Walsberg et al ., 1978). When\nthe skin is covered by a heavy pelage, passive transfer of\nwater vapour across the skin is negligible. In that case, the\nhigh humidity of the air immediately above the skin pre-vents signi\ufb01cant water vapour transfer unless the fur isstrongly ruf\ufb02ed. However, in the thermal windows, the hairis so short that both sensible and insensible water loss ispossible (de Lamo\net al ., 2001).

These include the\nSuri and\nHuacayo genotypes of alpaca that differ in follicle number,\nthe ratio of primary/secondary follicles and the occurrenceof natural shedding (Antonini, 2010). There are casual\nreports of SAC keepers on higher delicacy of the\nSuri variety\nas regards growth, diseases or mortality, and it is postu-lated that the curly hair might have less protective prop-erties against the harsh Andean climatic conditions.\nShearing\nHeat stress . The speci\ufb01c integumental characteristics descri-\nbed for SAC indicate that they have developed adaptation\nmechanisms particularly suited fo r cooler climates. Accord-\ningly, hyperthermia might become a problem in hot, humidareas outside of their orginal habitat (Fowler, 1994).\nIn several studies, the bene\ufb01cial effect of shearing on\nthermoregulation against heat stress was shown.

However, usual sheep-\nshearing machines would leave residual \ufb01bre lengths of about1 cm and less. When the insulative effect of the \ufb02eece isreduced, the increased heat loss may be compensated by ahigher metabolic rate (de Lamo, 1990) according to climaticconditions. But, this compensation mechanism requires theintake of an adequate energy content in the diet, which isfrequently not provided by the available native forage.

Therefore, the purpose of the study reported here was to provide values for respiratory mechanical function and results of BALF cytologic examination in healthy adult alpacas, which would allow for the use of these diagnostic tools in clinical patients.\nMaterials and Methods\nAnimals\u2014Sixteen healthy client-owned adult al-\npacas (9 males and 7 females) were included in the \nstudy . Alpacas were between 2 and 9 years of age (mean \u00b1 SD, 3.5 \u00b1 2.1 years). Body weight ranged from 49 to 109 kg (mean body condition score, 4 on a scale\n37 \nof 1 to 9). The alpacas belonged to 3 farms that used similar housing conditions. Alpacas were housed on grass pastures and were fed supplemental grass hay and commercially available concentrate for alpacas. No signs of respiratory disease were reported, and none of the alpacas had been subjected to pulmonary function testing or a laboratory environment. The alpacas were admitted to our veterinary hospital at least 1 day prior to testing; they were housed in a well-ventilated stall bedded with straw and provided ad libitum access to grass hay . All lung function testing was performed in a temperature-controlled environment. Written client consent was obtained for all alpacas prior to enrollment in the study . All procedures were approved by the Clin-ical Sciences Research Committee at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at T ufts University .\nDesign\u2014A complete history and results of physi-\ncal examination, lateral thoracic radiography , a CBC, and serum biochemical analysis were obtained prior to study enrollment to exclude alpacas with any evidence of preexisting respiratory disease. Body measurements (height measured at the highest point of the shoul-ders [ie, withers], body length from point of shoulder to ischial tuberosity , and chest circumference over the eighth intercostal space) were obtained by use of a flex-ible measuring tape with the alpacas in a standing po-sition.

The thoracic and abdominal bands were placed in a vertical position.\nMonosinusoidal FOT\u2014The monosinusoidal FOT \n(1 to 7 Hz) was used to determine R\nRS and XRS as de-\nscribed elsewhere.6,39 The R RS comprises the additive \neffects of airway resistance, chest wall resistance, and R\nL.

A protective mouth gag was placed to allow inspection of the larynx with the aid of a laryngoscope. An enteral feeding tube\nb (250 cm \nin length and 6 mm in diameter) that contained a guide wire was inserted into the trachea of each alpaca and advanced until it wedged into a bronchus or bronchi-ole. The guide wire was then removed, and an aliquot of 30 to 50 mL of sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) solution was instilled and immediately aspirated for sample col-lection.

The ease with which pulmonary function testing was performed in conscious alpacas may provide an opportunity to use these noninvasive tests as ancillary diagnostic tools in clinical patients. Analysis of BALF will allow further characterization of respiratory disease conditions in  \ncamelids.\nThe FRC obtained in alpacas was comparable to \nresults reported in other standing nonintubated foregut fermenters, with a relatively greater FRC per kilogram of body weight in species with lower body mass. Cattle\n7 \nhave the lowest FRC relative to body weight (39.4 mL/kg), followed by llamas6 (40 mL/kg), alpacas (46 mL/\nkg), and sheep43 (52 mL/kg). Functional residual ca-\npacity is the passive balance between the inward elastic recoil of a lung and outward elastic recoil of the chest wall.\n5 Thus, species-associated differences in FRC may \nbe related to the chest wall and lung compliance, ab-dominal volume, posture, and shape of the chest and diaphragm.\n7,13,43 In alpacas, FRC was significantly cor -\nrelated (r = 0.645; P = 0.003) with body weight, which is similar to observations in horses\n11 and dogs of the \nsame breed.13 In contrast, FRC was only correlated with \nbody length in llamas,6 whereas positive associations \nbetween FRC and circumference, body weight, and length have been reported in sheep.\n9 Variation in body \ncondition and type may partly explain the failure of al-lometric scaling to predict FRC on the basis of body weight within and between species. For example, body weight fails to be useful for predicting FRC in dogs, in which body shape differs substantially with a breed\n12\u201314 \nFigure 1\u2014Diagrams depicting RIP and pneumotachographic signals in a representative \nclinically normal alpaca.

However, relative changes \nin FRC may serve as an important index of pulmonary dysfunction. For example, reduced lung compliance (eg, pulmonary fibrosis) and loss of lung volume relat-ed to pneumonia or pulmonary infiltrates may reduce FRC.\n6 The helium dilution technique for determination \nof FRC was uncomplicated and tolerated well by all un-trained and nonsedated alpacas in the present study .\nAlpacas had a greater abdominal (ie, diaphragmatic \nand abdominal muscle) contribution than the ribcage (ie, intercostal muscle) contribution to ventilation at rest. This was indicated by the larger signal for the ab-dominal contribution, compared with the signal for the thoracic contribution (Figure 1), which is similar to observations in llamas.\n6 In humans, however, the con-\ntribution of ribcage motion predominates over abdomi-nal movement during quiet breathing.\n44 Healthy horses \nhave an approximately equal thoracic and abdominal contribution to ventilation at rest.\n45,46 These differenc-\nes may be explained by the relative smaller chest size, greater percentage of the thorax located underneath the forelimb, and possibly lower active excursion of the rib-cages of alpacas during respiration in comparison with these factors in adult horses.\n45\nIn addition to the larger contribution from the ab-\ndomen, the timing was such that abdominal contribu-tion (reflecting diaphragmatic motion) led thoracic (re-flecting thoracic motion) movement in all alpacas, thus resulting in a minimal phase angle of 19.59 \u00b1 10.06\u00b0 in standing alpacas and 17.56 \u00b1 9.12\u00b0 in sternally re-cumbent alpacas. In healthy horses, the abdominal compartment can initiate respiration in a subset of ani-mals,\n46 with a mean phase angle of 8.3\u00b0 to 17.3\u00b0. The \nphase angle is a measurement of thoracoabdominal synchrony with values > 90\u00b0 indicating paradoxical respiration and values > 180\u00b0 representing complete thoracoabdominal asynchrony . In healthy llamas, the movement of the thorax and abdomen reportedly is synchronous\n6; however, the phase angle \nhas not been measured in this species.6 \nDiseased camelids may have major abnor -\nmalities in the breathing pattern, which are easily determined by use of RIP .\n1 In horses, \nfor example, RIP was used to verify that patients with recurrent airway obstruction have a significantly greater phase angle (62 \u00b1 18.6\u00b0), compared with the phase angle in control animals, and that the thorax is lead-ing respiration in most diseased animals.\n46 \nLower airway obstruction leads to an in-crease in the difference between plethysmo-graphic and nasal flow during the first 25% of expiration. The mean difference in flow recorded in the healthy alpacas of the pres-ent study (0.18 \u00b1 0.07 L/s) was similar to values obtained in llamas\n6 (0.04 \u00b1 0.14 L/s).\nIn the present study , mean VT in stand-\ning alpacas was 12 mL/kg, which is similar to values reported in horses\n7,47,48 and dogs14 \nbut higher than values in llamas (7 mL/kg),6 \ncattle (8 mL/kg),7,47 and sheep (6 to 7 mL/\nkg).43 Compared with llamas,6 alpacas have \na larger VT, longer Ti and Te, and lower VE \nand respiratory frequency . The observed species differ -\nences may relate to absolute differences in lung volume, dynamic compliance, size or shape of the abdomen, or relative abdominal mass.\nBecause some alpacas have a tendency to become \nsternally recumbent when nervous or intimidated, RIP results were obtained in standing and sternally recum-bent animals. A significantly higher V\nT, PIF , and PEF \nwere observed in the sternally recumbent alpacas, com-pared with values in standing alpacas, without altera-tion in respiratory frequency . We speculate that a shift in abdominal organs during sternal recumbency may have allowed for a larger V\nT and consequently a higher \nPIF and PEF .\nValues for R RS were higher in the alpacas of the pres-\nent study than in llamas6 across all impulse frequencies.",

In another study ,\n6 investigators validated the use of noninvasive \nFOT in healthy llamas by detecting a positive correla-tion between R\nL measured via esophageal balloon pneu-\nmotachography and RL measured via FOT. Although \nthe conventional esophageal balloon technique serves as a criterion-referenced standard, it is a time-consum-ing and moderately invasive procedure and therefore not ideal for the assessment of compromised animals. In contrast to conventional techniques, FOT also al-lows for the rapid differentiation of upper airway ver -\nsus pulmonary disease. This delineation is obtained by comparing R\nRS at 1 Hz, which predominantly reflects \nlower airway function, with RRS at higher impulse fre-\nquencies that characterize the central and upper airway diameter. This feature is particularly desirable for the evaluation of camelids because their narrow nasal pas-sages contribute substantially to total R\nRS.

Thus, use of the FOT may al-low for rapid, noninvasive localization of dysfunction to the upper airway in these patients. Accurate place-ment of the face mask, with a latex shroud secured over the bony portion of the nasal passages, is instrumental to avoid inadvertent narrowing of the airways during pulmonary function testing. The R\nRS as determined by \nthe use of FOT was not significantly different between sternally recumbent and standing alpacas.\nCytologic evaluation of the BALF revealed per -\ncentages of alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes similar to those reported in horses, but the mean per -\ncentage of neutrophils was higher in the alpacas of the present study (11%) than in healthy horses (<  5%).\n23 \nThis finding may mimic the higher peripheral neutro-phil count in alpacas, with an apparently greater leu-kocyte response to bacterial infection than is evident for horses.\n42 Artificial blood contamination was con-\nsidered an unlikely cause of the higher BALF neutro-phil percentages because a minimal number of RBCs were identified during cytologic examination. Theo-retically , cell populations could have been impacted on the basis of sampling location if BALF were partial-ly obtained from bronchi versus terminal bronchioles in some alpacas. No mast cells were identified with the use of toluidine blue, a staining technique that can improve the recognition of mast cells in equine BALF .\n40 In contrast to results for clinically normal \nhorses, BALF of alpacas also contained numerous cili-ated epithelial cells that line the trachea and bronchi in vivo. In humans, the presence of large numbers of ciliated epithelial cells in the BALF has been related to smoke inhalation\n49 or viral infections, which did not \npertain to the alpacas of our study . We speculate that BALF sampling in alpacas may have induced minor airway trauma and thus led to the recovery of ciliated epithelial cells. The described BAL technique yielded samples with adequate cellularity and resulted in no complications in these healthy alpacas, but its use may be limited in clinical patients because short-term in-jectable anesthesia was required.\nPulmonary function testing may be a rapid, non-\ninvasive, well-tolerated modality for use in improving the characterization and localization of respiratory dys-function in alpacas. In contrast, collection of BALF for cytologic examination may not be successful without the use of chemical restraint in smaller camelids. The study reported here revealed pertinent differences in results of cytologic evaluation of BALF and respiratory mechanical function of healthy alpacas, compared with values reported for other domestic species.\na.

Introduction  \nLittle information is currently available concerning the metabolism and nutritional needs of pseudoruminant \nSouth American camelids. For this reason studies (Robinson et al. 2005, 2006, Davies et al. 2007a and 2007b) have \nbeen conducted in order to better understand their nutritional requirements and water metabolism (R\u00fcbsamen \nand Engelhardt, 1975 ).  Llama and alpaca are distinguished by their ability to live at high altitude in climates too \nharsh for domestic ruminants to thrive.  It has been sug gested that alpacas (a close relative to the llama) are \nsimilar to llamas in respect to physiology and nutrient metabolism.  In order to ascertain if nutrient metabolism \ndifferences exist between these two species, alpacas and llamas were studied while con suming three types of \nforages with differing protein and carbohydrate quality.  The objectives of this study were to determine if serum \nand urine analytes, renal clearance, and fractional excretion of electrolyte and metabolite indices differed between \nalpacas and llamas fed either alfalfa, barley or grass hays.  \n2. Materials and methods  \nThis experiment was conducted with the approval of the Brigham Young University Institutional Animal Care \nand Use Committee and followed humane animal care and husbandry pra ctices.  Clinically normal, adult gelding \nllamas (n = 4; 3 yrs old; 123\u00b18 kg body weight (BW)) and gelding alpacas (n = 4; 3 yrs old; 60\u00b14 kg BW) were used in \nthis experiment.  The animals were acclimated for 72 hrs to handling areas and metabolism crates (Davies et al. \n2007a), and had ad libitum access to water and hay.  The study animals were deemed to be clinically normal on the \nbasis of history, physical examination findings, and results of CBC and serum biochemistry analysis.  During the \nstudy, the cam elids were housed in the metabolism crates (Davies et al. 2007a) but had twice daily 30 min exercise \nperiods in a concrete -based paddock.   \nThree different forage treatments with differing protein quantity and carbohydrate quality, alfalfa (AH), \nbarley (BH ), or grass hay (GH), were fed in random order (Table 1).  Animals were weighed with a digital scale \nimmediately before and after each of the three treatment periods to calculate each camelid\u2019s average body weight \nduring each treatment.  Each treatment per iod lasted 14 days.  Day 1 through 12 was used for feed acclimation, \nand d13 and d14 were used to collect timed urine and blood samples.  Two days before each collection period, \nanimals were fitted with a urine collection harness (Davies et al. 2007a) that  consisted of a latex funnel attached to \nthe caudoventral portion of the abdomen over the preputial area with a slight vacuum applied to draw urine into \ntubing attached to a plastic collection flask.  Twenty -four hrs prior to initiation of this study, came lids were fitted \nwith an indwelling jugular venous catheter (Micro -Renathane\u00ae .080\u201dx .040\u201d, Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA).  \nTimed blood and urine samples were collected over twelve 4 -hr intervals to determine each camelids renal \nclearance and fracti onal excretion measurements.  During each collection period, 10ml of blood was obtained from \neach animal via intravenous catheter.  Blood was allowed to clot, then centrifuged at 2000g for 20 min to separate \nserum from cellular fractions.  Serum aliquots w ere frozen at -80\u02daC for future analysis.  The urine volume excreted \nwas measured every 4 hr, and samples were collected, aliquoted and frozen at -80\u02daC for future analysis.  \nSerum and urine samples were analyzed for Na, K, Cl, and urea N using a NOVA 16 analyzer (NOVA \nBiomedical, Waltham, MA).  Serum and urine creatinine were determined by colorimetric method (#C513 -480; \nTECO Diagnostics, Anaheim, CA).",

Dry matter intake, g/kg.75/d, is shown in Table 2.  Overall feed intake was \nsignificantly higher for llamas on a metabolic body weight b asis than alpacas (P<0.05).  Llamas consumed an \naverage of 52.3 g/d/MBW of feed while alpacas consumed an average of 36.0 g/d/MBW.

Alpacas had similar CLCl values for each \nof the three forages consumed,  whereas llamas had a higher CLCl when fed AH.  The CLK was similar between \nthese species when consuming the same forage treatment, but was higher for llamas when fed AH.  Urea N \nclearance was affected by forage (P<0.001), but was similar between alpacas a nd llamas consuming the same diet \ntreatment, with the highest urea N clearance associated with consumption of AH.  Creatinine clearance was \nunaffected by forage and was similar between species on a MBW basis when animals consumed AH or BH, but was \nsignific antly higher in alpacas when fed GH.   \nFractional excretion (Table 6) of Na, K, and urea N was affected by forage (P<0.05). The FENa for sodium was \nhighest for both species when BH was consumed.  The FECl was not different between forage treatments, but wa s \naffected by species, with llamas having the highest FE values when fed AH and BH followed by GH.  The FE of urea \nN was highest in both alpacas and llamas fed AH (P<0.05) than the other two forages.  However, for urea N there \nwas a forage by species inter action (P<0.001).  Potassium FE was not different between llamas and alpacas or \nbetween forages.  The urinary FL for sodium and chloride (umol/min/kg) was significantly higher (P<0.05) for GH in \nalpacas only, while all other treatments had a similar FL of these electrolytes for both species.  The FLK was highest \nwhen measured as ml/min/kg in alpacas consuming GH, but on a MBW basis, was not different between species or \nforages.  The FL for urea N was affected by forage and exhibited a forage by species inte raction (P<0.001), with the \nhighest values associated with consumption of AH in llamas when measured on both a kg and MBW basis (P<0.05).  \nThere were also species differences in the TA of Na, Cl and K, on a umol/min/kg basis, being highest (P<0.05) for \nalpaca fed GH.  However, when calculated on a MBW basis, the difference between alpacas and llamas was only \nsignificant for GH.   \nCorrelations between FE, TE and CL (Table 9) indicated that these parameters correlated well for sodium for \nboth species fed AH, but was less for BH.  Alpacas fed GH did not correlate well, while llamas did.  The other \nelectrolyte FE to TE correlations were low.  This was also true for urea N.  The correlation between TE and CL were \nsignificant for all electrolytes, but less so for urea N.  \n4. Discussion  \nThe alfalfa, barley, and grass forages in this study were selected to provide a wide range of nutritional quality \ndefined as crude protein (CP), palatability and lignin content. In the case of AH, it had high quality (high CP, \npalatab ility and relatively low lignin), GH was intermediate  and BH was a low quality forage. Dry matter intake \n(g/d) in this study was similar to that presented by Robinson et al. (2005 and 2006) and Davies et al. (2007a and \n2007b) for alpacas and llamas fed alf alfa, barley and grass hays. In the aforementioned studies, DM intake \nbetween the species was significant, as was ours. When expressed on a MBW basis, intake differences between \nthe two species remained significant. The DM intake differences for diet were expected and indicative of AH being \nthe more palatable forage for both species.  \nUrine volume output was highest for the AH treatment by approximately 30 to 120%  for alpacas and 112% \nfor llamas with respect to the BH and GH treatments.",

Urine volume output is regulated by the kidneys in \nassociation with protein metabolism and the formation of nitrogenous wastes, primarily as urea nitrogen in \nmammals, along with th e electrolytes Na and K, and mainly affected by the control of osmolality (Kume et al. 2008 \nand Bannink et al. 1999).  Nitrogen intake calculated from DM intake and the forage CP values presented in Tables \n1 and 2 were 1.6, 0.5 and 0.6 g/MBW/d for alpacas fed AH, BH and GH, respectively.  A similar trend was noted for \nllamas; 2.2, 0.7 and 0.9 g/MBW/d for AH, BH and GH, respectively.  The increased N intake for the AH treatment \nresulted in an increased urine output as the kidneys maintained osmolality homeos tasis with increased levels of \nurea N removed by renal excretion.  \nThe changes observed in serum urea N (SUN) concentration were in response to forage consumption, with \nAH causing an almost 300% increase in N intake above the BH and GH treatments.  Our data  correspond to results \nseen in other studies where alpacas were fed alfalfa and grass hays Robinson et al. (2005).  Marini et al. (2004) \ndemonstrated this same effect in growing dairy heifers.  Total excretion of urine urea N (UUN) was highest for AH \nin co njunction with the higher N intake and corresponding elevation in SUN.  Plasma urea N (PUN) has been shown \nto be a good predictor of UUN (Kume et al. 2008 and Kohn et al. 2005) and similarly, as PUN increased, UUN did as \nwell.  Kojima et al.

Total  analyte excretion expressed on a \u00b5mol/min/kg and \u00b5mol/min/MBW basis were all significant \nfor forage except creatinine.  Creatinine is associated with muscle metabolism via its utilization of creatine \nphosphate an energy source, and is produced at a steady rate by the degradation of creatine.  Serum creatinine \nconcentration has been shown to inver sely reflect GFR, and creatinine clearance has previously been used in \ncamelids to approximate GFR as the amount of creatinine filtered (Lackey et al. 1995).  In our study, excretion of \ncreatinine was significant for species when expressed on a per kg basi s but not on a MBW basis.  The reason for \nthis difference was explained by Fleming et al. (1991), who indicated that herbivorous diets, devoid of exogenous \ncreatinine, are not expected to influence creatinine clearance unless prolonged inadequate dietary i ntake results in \na negative energy balance.  Muscle mass, activity level and renal function can also affect creatinine clearance.  The \ncamelids in this study were relatively inactive and healthy, so the difference in creatinine excretion between \nspecies on  a kg BW basis can be accounted for and is negated when expressed on a MBW basis.  \nTotal electrolyte excretion rates were correlated with fractional excretion rate when studied in sheep (Garry \net al. 1990). Fractional excretion was higher for Na and Cl in o ur animals than those reported for llamas by Lackey \net al. (1995), while K was lower.  Lefebvre et al. (2008) commented that there is normal intra -individual, as well as \nanimal to animal and between species variation in FE that is due to the body requireme nt for the electrolyte and \nmaintaining plasma levels within \u201cnormal\u201d levels to maintain homeostasis.  Clearance rate, as described by \nSwenson and Reece (1993), is a measure of the removal of a substance from the blood by the kidneys (such as a \nliter of blo od cleared of analyte/d/MBW).  The clearance of creatinine or CCR is often used as an estimate of GFR \nand was shown by Apple et al. (1989) to be very accurate (R2 = 0.92).  Fleming et al. (1991) explained that CCR is \nvariable between animals, but steady wi thin an animal.  This author concluded that because there was no time \nvariation in their 6 -hour collection period, CCR is a valid estimate of GRF in ruminants and herbivores.  The mean \nCCR values calculated in our study were based on data collected over tw o days, providing a stable data set.  We \nalso used CCR to approximate GFR in camelids with the understanding that a small fraction of creatinine may also \nbe secreted by the glomerulus.  The GFR estimate for alpacas and llamas in our study is similar to tha t reported by \nothers for camels and sheep (Fleming et al. 1991, Kamili et al. 2013 and Nawaz and Shah 1984).  \n5. Conclusion  \nThese data demonstrate the effects of forage on serum and urine analytes  and though there are some \ndifferences between the two camelid species, the major affect for differences in these analytes was from the \neffect of the forages.  Species differences between alpacas and llamas may stem back to the greater DM intake of \nthe for ages by llamas and the associated increase in N consumption, particularly when high protein legumes like \nalfalfa hay are fed.  \nAcknowledgement  \nThe authors wish to thank Micah Sharp, Christina Horey, Joseph Anderson and Adam Peterson for their \nassistance wit h animal care and laboratory analysis.  \nReferences  \nAlbin, R.C., Clanton, D.C., 1966.

The effects of these \ninterventions on the physiology, and thus welfare, of wild vicunas are unknown. As a first \nstep to quantifying and thus mitigating any adverse welfare consequences of this harvest, we measured the immediate and longer-term physical and physiological effects of capture, \nshearing and transport. A sample of juvenile male vicunas was captured. Six were shorn at \nthe capture site, six after two weeks in captivity, and the remaining seven animals were kept as controls for 39 days. In general, vicunas showed changes in blood glucose, packed cell \nvolume, cortisol, and neutrophil :lymphocyte ratios within 4\u20136 h following capture. Creatine \nkinase was also affected by capture and transport, showing a peak plasma level 24 h after capture, which was followed by a peak plasma level of aspartate aminotransferase four days \nafter capture and transport. After 12 days in captivity, all of the vicunas showed \nphysiological parameters close to expected baseline values for the species. We could detect no differences in physiological parameters between animals that were captured, sheared and \ntransported and those that were only captured and transported. Similarly, we could detect no \ndifferences in most responses of vicunas between those sheared after 12 days in captivity and a control group held under similar conditions but from which blood was sampled without \nshearing. A further comparison between animals sheared immediately after capture and \nanimals sheared after 12 days in captivity revealed that creatine kinase levels were higher in the former group. During transport prior to release back into the wild, only minor injuries \n(lip bleeding and limb contusions) and a significant increase in rectal temperature were \nobserved. Our results provide a basis for recomme ndations to improve the welfare of vicunas \nduring the wool harvest, and provide baseline and stress-response data to serve as reference \npoints for further studies of vicuna welfare.  \n \nKeywords : animal welfare, capture effects, ecophys iology, shearing effect s, stress response, \nsustainable use \n \nIntroduction \nThe vicuna (or vicu\u00f1a, Vicugna vicugna ), a wild South American Camelid, is regularly \ncaptured, handled and sheared, and this practi ce has occurred since the 15th century, when \nthe Inca Empire conducted a round-up, known as the chaku , throughout the Andes of South \nAmerica (Hurtado 1987; Torres 1992). The chaku  involved herding thousands of animals \ninto stone corrals for shearing. Large numbers  of animals were shorn using this method;",
        "95b853f4-ad9e-4995-bd67-69b4374698d1": "Bonacic and Macdonald  \n \n \n \n388 Animal Welfare 2003, 12: 387-402 probably whatever morbidity and mortality resulted (and there are no records of this) had \nlittle effect on the population because the chaku  took place in a given locality only once \nevery four years. Furthermore, prior to the arrival of Europeans, vicunas were abundant in the Andes (Koford 1957; Hurtado 1987). \n When Europeans arrived in South America, the traditional chaku  was replaced by \nindiscriminate hunting (Hoffmann et al 1983; Cueto et al 1985; Hurtado 1987; CONAF \n1991). The number of vicunas rapidly declined, probably through the combined impact of hunting, livestock competition and, possibly, diseases introduced by European domestic livestock (Koford 1957). By the 1950s the species faced extinction, but their decline was \nsuccessfully reversed by the introduction of a 30-year moratorium (Bonacic et al 2002). \nLocal communities observed this moratorium \u2014 enduring the loss of vicuna wool and meat, and tolerating perceived competition with livestock \u2014 in the expectation that they would see long-term benefits from the sustainable use of vicuna wool, a luxury product that attracts a \nhigh premium on international markets. Attempts to realise this potential market rest, under \nthe dictates of CITES, on in vivo  harvest of the vicuna\u2019s wool. Clearly, this might be \nachieved by various means and, in evaluating the alternatives, one consideration is the \nwelfare of the animals. Here, we report on our  assessment of the welfare consequences of \nvarious aspects of the harvest. \n Current policies for vicuna management include capture and shearing of wild animals, \nfarming, ranching, translocation and reintroduction (Cueto et al 1985; Torres 1987; Urquieta \n& Rojas 1990; Torres 1992; Rebuffi 1993; Urquieta et al 1994; Wheeler & Hoces 1997; \nGalaz 1998). For example, during the early 1990s, wild vicunas were translocated, by road \nand air, from Peru, Argentina and Chile to a Natural Reserve in Ecuador to begin a reintroduction programme (CITES 1997). \n The welfare implications of the handling and transportation of domestic stock are a long-\nstanding topic of research (Goddard et al 1996; Grigor et al 1997a; Grigor et al 1997b). \nAlthough less scientific attention has been given to welfare as an element of wildlife \nconservation and management, it is already clear that capture and transportation can cause stress in wild ungulates as well as in carnivores and birds (Bailey et al 1996; DeNicola & \nSwihart 1997; Grigor et al 1998; Little et al 1998). In ungulates such as red deer ( Cervus \nelaphus ) and white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ), capture and immobilisation are \nknown to cause stress, as indicated by changes in haematological and biochemical blood constituents (Wesson et al 1979; Vassart et al 1992; Beringer et al 1996; DeNicola & \nSwihart 1997; Marco et al 1998). Specifically, capture a nd restraint can cause capture \nmyopathy, also named exertional myopathy (for a review, see Wesson et al 1979; Beringer \net al 1996; Williams & Thomas 1996; DeNicola & Swihart 1997). Capture myopathy is \ncaused by complex metabolic changes that may result in hyper-acute  fatal acid\u2013base and \nelectrolyte imbalances (Fowler 1998). Various biological and haematological parameters are known to vary according to the capture method , species and previous capture experience \n(Morton et al 1995). Capture myopathy is a syndrome resulting from excessive exercise and \nmultiple traumas during capture and handling that produces dramatic changes in the activity of creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, packed cell volume and cortisol (Radostits \net al 1994). \n Interpretation of the physiological respons e to capture requires  caution because of \nvariation with age, season and, notably, species (see Bonacic et al, pp 369\u2013385, this issue).",

        "23233b3d-b5af-4e7c-a3bc-f54b113063ef": "Impact of wool harvesting in vicunas \n \n \n \nAnimal Welfare 2003, 12: 387-402 389 respiratory rate and packed cell volume (Eckert & Randall 1983; Schmidt-Nielsen 1997; \nRadostits et al 1994; Harris et al 1999). A less acute response (ie from minutes to hours) is \nobserved in blood glucose, plasma cortisol and creatine kinase concentrations (Coles 1980; \nKaneko et al 1997; Bateson & Wise 1998; Harris et al 1999). Finally, some parameters \nchange only on a time-scale of hours to days, such as aspartate aminotransferase, total \nprotein, and blood urea nitrogen (Kaneko et al 1997; Harris et al 1999). \n In the case of vicunas, our concern was that  capture and shearing \u2014 activities essential to \nthe planned sustainable harvest of wool \u2014 could result in morbidity and potential mortality; \nindeed, shearing is known to cause a risk of fatal hypothermia in other South American \nCamelids (Fowler 1998). Adverse signs of shearing in llamas (as in sheep) include decreased \nheart and respiratory rates, hypothermia and an  increase in packed cell volume, accompanied \nby hypotension and a state of physical depression or lack of activity (Radostits et al 1994; \nFowler 1998). \n Various capture, transport and shearing methods are currently used for vicunas throughout \nSouth America. The simplest capture me thod, in Peru, emulates the ancient chaku  and \ninvolves people slowly herding groups of between 20 and 500 vicunas into a wire-fenced corral (Wheeler & Hoces 1997). Elsewhere, and commonly in Chile, motorbikes and pick-\nups are used to drive small groups of animals for up to five kilometres  into fenced corrals \n(Bonacic 2000). Some people use combinations of these approaches. Once in the corral, the vicunas are either restrained with ropes until they are shorn or wait  unrestrained in an \nadjacent corral. \n The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different capture and handling \nstrategies on selected physiological parameters. Here, we report on an experiment designed \nto disentangle the characteristics and relative magnitudes of physiological indicators of stress \nassociated with each of a) capture, b) shearin g, and c) transportation, and the effects of \nhabituation on the vicuna\u2019s response to stress. We provide capture and handling \nrecommendations that optimise animal welfare and thus also maximise harvest sustainability. \n \nMethods \nStudy area \nThe study took place in Las Vicunas National Reserve (209 131 ha; South 18\u00b016'\u201319\u00b000' and \nWest 68\u00b057'\u201369\u00b027') in Chile, which lies within the Surire basin in the Parinacota Province \n(490 401 ha) and has been used as a centre for research on the sustainable use of the vicuna (CONAF 1991). Rainfall (annual mean 200\u2013 321 mm) is concentrated in summer \n(December\u2013March); July is th e coldest month with a mean temperature of \u20130.04\u00b0C, and \nJanuary the warmest with a mean of 8\u00b0C. The study was conducted in November 1998. \n \nExperimental design \nVicunas were captured at Site Number 32 with in The Las Vicunas Na tional Reserve in the \nnorthern region of Chile at 4400 m above sea leve l, in an open grassland plain with steppe \nvegetation surrounded by mountains and bisected by a main road. Capture facilities were \nbuilt at the middle of the site, 100\u2013200 m east of a road. In the cour se of local shearing \noperations, 19 juvenile male vicunas were herded by vehicles into a corral (15 m \u00d7 25 m). Some were shorn immediately with mechanical clippers (Lister\u00ae) used  for sheep. However, \nbecause vicunas are less tractable than sheep, shearing involved two people holding the \nanimal prostrate on the ground (one at its head holding the forelegs, the other to the rear and \nholding the hindlegs), while a third person sheared the animal\u2019s back and flanks. All of the \nvicunas, whether shorn or not, were then transported carefully in a Toyota double-cabin",

The \nanimals were transported in the same way after the study was completed, and clinical examination and any injuries during transport were recorded. \n Physical examination and blood sampling were carried out after capture, after transport to \nthe capture facilities, and after shearing. The vicunas were allocated at random to one of three treatments:  \na) C-T: controls animals which were maintained in captivity but were not shorn during the \nentire captive period (n = 7); \nb) C-S-T: sheared immediately at capture and prior to transportation to the holding facility; \nthus the effects of capture and shearing were acting together (n = 6); \nc) C-T-S12: sheared after 12 days in captivity with the aim of allowing the animals to recover \nfrom the initial stress of capture and transport (n = 6).  \n The shearing experiment conducted on day 12 compares animals that were not shorn with \nshorn animals; both groups were handled in the same way during the same period in captivity. This design seeks to minimise the confounding effects of capture and transport on \nthe effect of shearing (see Appendix). Because our approach involves in vivo  sampling from \nunanaesthetised animals, stress associated with handling is a component of each treatment. \n At capture, and on days 1, 2, 4 and 12, blood samples were taken from each animal. In \naddition, rectal temperature, heart rate an d respiratory rate were recorded daily. The \nhaematological parameters were: packed cell volume (PCV), total white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, eosinophil count, monocyte count, and \nneutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (N:L ratio). The biochemical assays on blood plasma were: \nblood glucose concentration (GLU), cortisol conc entration (CORT), and activity levels of the \nserum enzymes creatine kinase (CK) an d aspartate aminotransferase (AST). \n \nBlood sampling and analysis \nBlood samples were obtained by jugular venepuncture from the upper section of the neck \n(Urquieta & Rojas 1990; Fowler 1994), following Fowler\u2019s guidelines for llamas, except that \nan upper neck patch was shaved and disinfected with an alcohol\u2013iodine solution (Fowler 1998). The minimum amount of blood necessary was drawn, using 21 GX1 1/2'' UTW \nneedles (Venoject\u00ae) and 5 ml blood tubes (Vacutainer\u00ae; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, \nNJ, USA) which contained ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and heparin, for haemogram and cortisol measurements, respectively (Schalm & Jain 1986; Kaneko et al \n1997). \n Blood smears were prepared following standard procedures for sampling wild ungulates in \nthe field, by placing a drop of fresh blood, using a glass capillary (of 75 mm/75 \u00b5l), onto a \nMarienfeld\u00ae slide and smearing with another slide (76 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 1 mm approximately; Fowler \n1986; Rhiney 1982). The smear was fixed with methanol and the slide labelled with a graphite pencil, in preparation for Giemsa staining and differential white blood cell counts \n(Coles 1980; Schalm & Jain 1986). These counts were carried out using standard procedures \nin the Veterinary School of the University of Chile (Coles 1980; Schalm & Jain 1986). Total white cell counts were undertaken for each sample in the field using a Neubauer\u00ae improved \nbright line camera (Precicolor of 0.100 mm by 0.0025 mm\n2) (Coles 1980; Schalm & Jain \n1986). Under the extreme and remote field conditions of the study area, no automatic blood counter was available. Plasma was extracted by  centrifugation and stored in a nitrogen tank \nwithin 2 h of collection for further enzyme and cortisol analysis.

The standard antibody, tracer and methodology were provided by the WHO matched reagent  programme (Hall 1978; Zekan & Ezcurra 1998). The antibody is raised in rabbits and has a sensitivity of 10.5 nmol l\n\u20131.

From this, we deduce that shearing does not add to the burden of the other two stressors. The extremely \nhigh CK values from captured and sheared animals compared to C-T-S12 animals suggests \nthat capture, unsurprisingly, is an acute stre ss stimulus. The group of animals sheared after \n12 days in captivity (C-T-S12) showed no significant differences in the majority of the physiological values compared to unsheared an imals (C-T), except that cortisol and AST \nconcentrations were high er in sheared animals (48 h and 72  h after shearing, respectively). \nWe deduce, then, that shearing adds to the burden  of handling only in so far as the cortisol \nand AST values indicate additional stre ss. A comparison between C-S-T and C-T-S12 \nanimals showed that those shorn immediately afte r capture had significantly higher CK levels \nthan those shorn after they had become accustom ed to captivity and handing.

During \ntransport to release the animals back into the w ild (day 40), minor injuries (ie small lip cuts \nand limb contusions) and a significant increas e in rectal temperature were observed. \nAlthough these injuries were slight, the jo urney in this case was short compared with \ntranslocation practices used in the altiplano,  where animals are transported for more than \n50 km, which raises concern that longer journeys might pose more significant welfare problems. Irrespective of the impact of variable journey length, which remains to be \nexplored, other studies have identified loading/unloading as the main cause of injuries in \ndomestic species (S Wolfensohn, personal communication 2002). \n Capture and transport of vicunas are increasing ly widespread practices associated with the \ntrend to establish vicuna farms in South America; within these farms vicunas will be sheared. \nIn addition, the traditional prac tice of rounding up and shearing free-living vicunas continues. \nOur intention has been to evaluate the e ffects of capture, transport and shearing on \nphysiological and physical parameters in captive wild vicunas following similar procedures that are currently in place for vicuna use. We have sought to provide the first reference \nvalues with which to evaluate the impact of management on this wild species. This \ninformation is important for judging the acceptabi lity of the wool harvest, and for evaluating \nthe merits of alternative management and handling protocols. Handling and repeated sampling are important stressors in domestic and wild animals (Goddard 1998). Using animals that were part of a local shearing programme, it was opportune to monitor a small \nsample of individuals held in captivity to s ecure physiological measures as reference values \nfor future vicuna farming operations. These captured animals, maintained under three regimes (C-T, C-S-T and C-T-S12) served as  their own reference points and controls. \n Capture stress has been described for other ungulate species (Seal et al 1972; Conner et al \n1987; Beringer et al 1996; Coulson 1996; Vassart et al 1992; Antognini et al 1996; Williams \n& Thomas 1996; Marco & Lavin 1999).

        "04dee407-876f-49e2-a8e6-d0d787cf02f5": "Impact of wool harvesting in vicunas \n \n \n \nAnimal Welfare 2003, 12: 387-402 397  We found a strong positive correlation between cortisol concentration immediately after \ncapture (in all three groups) and later values based on samples taken during the 39 days in captivity. We interpret this as indicating that some individuals were consistently more \u2018nervous\u2019 than others \u2014 a conclusion compatible with our findings during a trial of \nindividual responses to ACTH injection (see Bonacic et al, pp 369\u2013385, this issue). \n The comparison between animals shorn unde r C-S-T and C-T-S12 treatments revealed \nsignificant differences only in cortisol and AST. From this we deduce that the stress associated with capture, handling and shearing of unhabituated animals differs from that of habituated animals handled and shorn only in so  far as higher cortisol and AST in the C-S-T \ngroup indicate that they were more stressed. The fact that the stress levels associated with \nshearing in both treatments were not high is, importantly, in contrast with earlier findings by Bonacic (2000). An explanation may lie in th e fact that the current experiments were \nconducted in austral spring, whereas the earlier publication, which reported severe stress and \nassociated mortality, was conducted in the austral autumn. \n The vicuna\u2019s fine fleece is an adaptation to its highly variable envi ronment, characterised \nby large daily temperature fluctuations and intense solar radiation (Wilson 1989; Koford 1957; INIA 1989; CONAF 1991). Obviously, shear ing takes from the animal an attribute that \nnatural selection has demonstrated to be of survival value, and thus is likely to be \ndisadvantageous. It is not obvious, however, just how disadvantageous shearing is and how its negative impacts can best be mitigated by alternative protocols. Motivated by similar questions, Lobel (1992) studied the effe cts of winter shearing in alpacas ( Lama pacos ), in a \ntrial conducted in Mediterranean conditions and below 1000 m in Central Chile. She \nconcluded that shearing alpaca in winter cau sed stress, on the grounds that fleece removal \ncaused an increase in plasma cortisol and lower rectal temperature. The most important changes in the haematological parameters were neutrophilia, lymphopenia and eosinopenia (Lobel 1992). In addition to the stress induced by shearing itself and by the associated \nprocedures of capture, handling and transport, which has been the topic of this paper, we \ncannot discard subtle longer-term consequences of shearing on the health and welfare of shorn vicunas exposed to wind and low temperatures overnight in the extreme climate of  the puna  ecosystem. That is the topic of our si ster paper in this series (see Bonacic et al, \npp 369\u2013385, this issue). \n A potential drawback of our approach is th at wild-caught animals in captivity might yield \nresults confounded by the stress of handling and, in the long-term, by chronic stress. Indeed, although our animals appeared to habituate to  handling, as evidenced  by the absence of \nvisible agitation and by the decline of their N:L ratio and CK concentrations, we were able to \ndiscount the possibility that they were chronically stressed only because we conducted (see Bonacic et al, pp 369\u2013385, this issue) a separate ACTH challenge to test this (stress-\nresponsiveness to ACTH provides a useful distinction between habituation and chronic stress; Beerda et al 1998). \n Animal welfare implications \nConservation is an inescapably inter-disciplinary, and highly practical, activity. It draws upon \nthe social sciences \u2014 economics and community development \u2014 and upon the biological \nsciences. Of the latter, behaviour and ecology are crucial elements of conservation biology; \nin addition, however, our study stems from the conviction that another biological discipline \u2014 welfare science \u2014 has an important contribution to make (see also Clemmons",

Welfare science should approach any problem from a physiological and \nbehavioural standpoint in a wise combination of markers that makes an evaluation an objective assessment. This paper emphasises the value of physiological data; behavioural analyses are underway. \n It is a great hope of wildlife conservationists, although one yet rarely seen to be realised, \nthat some wildlife can be used sustainably to the greater common good of the exploited \nspecies, its ecosystem, and the communities of the people using it (Eltringham 1988; Robinson & Redford 1991). Sustainable use is  often characterised as being either \nconsumptive, such as hunting quotas, or non-co nsumptive, such as eco-tourism. On closer \ninspection, however, this dichotomy can be some what blurred and, indeed, the case of the \nvicuna wool-harvest is somewhat intermediate. True, the captured, shorn vicunas are released \nalive back into the wild, but their use may have consequences both for the individual animals and for the population from which they were drawn. These consequences, both in terms of \nindividual welfare and population demography, are among the diverse and often \nincommensurable factors by which the desirability of this harvest will be judged. \n Our experiment has provided profiles of cortisol levels in vicunas following habituation, \nadrenocortical response to ACTH challenge (see Bonacic et al, pp 369\u2013385, this issue), the \nresponse of cortisol, CK and AST enzymes to capture and shearing, and WBC changes after \ncapture, transport and shearing. In total, 16 physical and physiological parameters have been quantified under different management conditi ons. The results therefore provide well-known \nmarkers of stress that can be used to interpre t future studies of vicuna welfare (Broom & \nJohnson 1993; Wolfensohn & Lloyd 1994; Webster 1995). Our results suggest that capture, \ntransport and shearing cause acute stress, but at levels with which the animals can cope. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis paper was completed while C Bonacic was an HSUS Fellow in the WildCRU \nProgramme for Studies of Animal Welfare in  Wildlife Conservation.
